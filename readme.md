# Archive Of ConflictHealth.com

I wrote Conflict Health for four years starting in 2008. However, in March 2014 I decided to take down the site instead of pay the $330 per year I was spending to host the site.

Hopefully Conflict Health will continue to be useful to researchers and others in the future through this repo.

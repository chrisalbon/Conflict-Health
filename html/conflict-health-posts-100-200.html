<p><span class="drop_cap">H</span>appy Veteran’s Day! If you are not a 
veteran, I encourage you to thank one for today for their service. A 
handshake goes a long way. Furthermore, whether or not you are a 
veteran, make sure to read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/opinion/11tierney.html?_r=2&amp;hp">this
 brilliant op-ed by Dominic Tierney of Swarthmore College on the America
 military’s long tradition doing Military Operations Other Than War 
(MOOTW)</a>. The punchline:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, some officers warn that an army of nation-builders
 would lose its edge at conventional warfare. But in keeping with the 
founders’ belief that the soldier’s role was to build, not just to 
destroy, we need our own multipurpose military — an Army and Marine 
Corps with duties that extend far beyond winning tank battles or 
artillery duels against enemy states, or even fighting at all. And just 
as in Jefferson’s time, West Point in the 21st century should supply a 
nation-builder’s education, and we should encourage its efforts to 
emphasize in its curriculum the study of foreign languages and cultures.</p>
<p>The troops from America’s farming heartlands who are helping Afghans 
build greenhouses, grow cops and better feed cattle are not losing their
 identity as warriors — they’re following in the footsteps of our 
earliest soldiers. </p></blockquote>
<p>Huge hat tip to <a href="http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama">Andrew Exum</a> for pointing out the op-ed.</p>

 water absolutely, positively has to be purified overnight, you call in 
the Marines? Maybe. Gary Anderson, a former Marine Corps officer and 
expert on humanitarian relief, <a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/2010/11/cholera-in-haiti-send-in-the-m/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">has a comment on Small Wars Journal</a> advocating for the deployment of Marines to Haiti:</p>
<blockquote><p>The situation in Haiti is on an order of magnitude 
greater than Abu Ghraib, but the principles of containment are still the
 same. However, there isn’t much time. The United States should 
immediately offer to transport Reverse Osmosis Purification Units 
(ROWPUs) to Haiti; these units are capable of producing huge amounts of 
potable water out of the vilest sources imaginable. The Marines are 
particularly adept at using ROWPUs for humanitarian purposes. That is 
only a temporary solution until the relief international relief 
community can organize a solid system of chlorine tablet distribution 
and public information.</p>
<p>Containing a cholera outbreak is relatively easy; developing a sense 
of urgency among Haitian officials, may be more difficult. I’m usually 
the last to suggest yet another commitment of U.S. forces; but they 
wouldn’t be there long, and aside from the ROWPUS, very few troops are 
needed. In this case, they are indispensible. Let’s send in the 
Marines…again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Offering ROWPUs to Haiti is a good idea, but I am not sure why 
Anderson puts so much emphasis on the Marine Corps providing them. 
Virgin Islands National Guard’s ROWPU Detachment already has experience 
in Haiti (pictured) and might well make a better choice. But, whoever we
 send, send them quickly.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">M</span>ore than a month ago Paul Farmer, 
Vanessa Bradford Kerry, and Sara Auld published an article in the 
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp1006501">proposing an International Health Service Corps (IHSC)</a> [PDF, might be gated]. A few weeks later, I <a href="http://www.currentintelligence.net/features/2010/10/18/creating-an-international-health-service-corps.html">published a comment to their article on Current Intelligence</a>
 highlighting the potential role of the military in any future IHSC. I 
encourage you all to go and read both Farmer et al’s original article 
and my comment. As a teaser, here is a punchline to the latter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ask any military or civilian personnel on a US medical 
assistance operation (and I have) why it’s important for America to 
repair medical equipment in Nicaragua or train medics in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, and you’ll get almost the exact same answer every
 time. Helping states provide health care to their populations can 
increase regional stability, build valuable diplomatic relationships 
between the US and foreign governments, and play an important role in 
that elusive old game: winning hearts and minds. By helping others in 
this way, Americans help themselves.</p>
<p>So is the IHSC a good idea? Absolutely. If it ever needs researchers 
I’ll be the first to sign up. We need to ensure, however, that the IHSC 
doesn’t simply reinvent the wheel. The US already has a proto-IHSC in 
the often-overlooked international health operations of its military and
 other uniformed services. </p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">N</span>inety-five percent of the books I read
 are dense monographs on military affairs and public health, and would 
never have much appeal to the general public. The fact I stay up late 
every night reading them is a solid sign that I have found a topic I am 
passionate about. In September however, I broke my pattern and bought my
 <a href="">very first comic book</a>, admittedly entirely because I am <a href="http://www.warisboring.com/">good friends with one of the authors</a>. But now it seems this comic book thing is catching on. Last month, the Naval Health Research Center <a href="http://www.dodlive.mil/index.php/2010/10/medical-monday-preparing-our-corpsmen-for-combat-related-stress/">published its own comic book on US medics</a>, called <a href="http://www.med.navy.mil/Navy%20Medicine%20Media%20Room/Pages/Publications.aspx">The Docs</a>, and I admit that it is pretty good. And the best part: it is <a href="http://www.med.navy.mil/Navy%20Medicine%20Media%20Room/Pages/Publications.aspx">free</a>!</p>

 Mariwan Husni, Fiona Taylor, and Narmen Koye provide a telling vignette
 on the power of politics to disrupt the education components of health 
systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>“After Saddam took power, extra-judicial killings 
extended to hundreds of doctors, academics and health care 
professionals. His loyal followers were employed on the academic staff 
without merit and replaced many of the qualified teaching staff in the 
universities. The new staff were given enhanced career opportunities, 
including scholarships in countries like the UK.</p>
<p>Subjects praising and promoting the Baath party’s doctrines were 
added to the medical school curriculum. These additional subjects were 
taught in Arabic, rather than English, which was the language of the 
curriculum. The admission requirements to medical schools were 
undermined by the regime because of favouritism towards loyal members of
 the Baath party and their children. These applicants were automatically
 given additional examination marks for being loyal to the political 
party, which discriminated against other students who were not 
supporters of the regime. Agents of the regime posed as students and 
staff to keep disloyal students under continuous surveillance.</p>
<p>The acceptance of less capable students and the change in Iraq’s 
international relations undermined the reputation of the Iraqi system of
 medical education in the region and the world. Books and publications 
stopped coming into the country, and there were no opportunities to 
interact with the international medical community. People were not 
allowed to attend conferences, meetings or postgraduate medical 
education outside of Iraq.” (Husni et al. 2006, 295)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ately I have been reading my way 
through the half a dozen or so modern war memoirs from military health 
workers (more on this later). This week, I am enjoying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584657472?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=humasecurevi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1584657472">Saber’s Edge: A Combat Medic in Ramadi, Iraq</a><img src="conflict-health-posts-100-200_files/ir_002.gif" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" border="0" height="1" width="1"> by Thomas A. Middleton. </p>
<p>I will write a full book review at a later date, but for now here is a
 particularly great explanation by Middleton of one aspect of US medic 
history. For a long time, US military medics were unarmed (or lightly 
armed) and wore Red Cross markings designating their status as health 
personnel. However, in Iraq and Afghanistan US medics are largely 
indistinguishable from the units with whom they are attached. Middleton 
explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike the medics of yesteryear, we no longer wore red 
crosses, and  today’s medics carry weapons. Historically, the Army 
placed the medic  in the same category as the medical officer-that of 
noncombatant. History   taught us, though, that the enemy did not always
 respect the Geneva  Convention, and in some cases, he would 
specifically target old Doc. The  Geneva Convention provides protection 
to noncombatant chaplains and  to medical officers who clearly identify 
themselves. It would be unethical   for us to wear the red crosses while
 still carrying a rifle and fighting  offensively – we would be 
dishonestly claiming protection as noncombatants.   During previous 
wars, the combat medic was either unarmed or  carried only a pistol. The
 .45-caliber Colt model 1911 became a hallmark  weapon, carried by 
officers and medics. The pistol was only effective at  short range, and 
was really designed to be used only in defense of one’s  self or one’s 
patients. It was not accurate enough to knock down targets  at longer 
distance, so there was little chance of a pistol-packing medic  leading a
 charge toward the enemy. During the Vietnam War, many combat   medics 
realized that their enemy did not always respect the covenants   of the 
Geneva Convention and would kill a medic as quickly as an  infantryman. 
Some of the enemy even figured out that if the medic was  wounded or 
killed, the rest of the troops might be less willing to fight-figuring  
 that no one was left to patch up their wounds. Current interpretation  
 of Army doctrine called for each medic to carry one primary  weapon 
(whether a pistol or a rifle) and possibly a secondary weapon as  well. 
The rifle was more valuable most of the time, but the pistol was better 
in close quarters or when the medic was busy working on a casualty.  It 
was always ready in the holster-even when the medic’s hands were  busy 
with other tasks-and it could be drawn, aimed, and fired more  quickly 
when reacting to a surprise attack at short range. Today’s medics  were 
prepared to fight when needed, and I was looking forward to it. I  am 
not sure that everyone had quite embraced the concept of soldier-medics 
  yet, but gunfighters we would prove to be. (Middleton 2009)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">D</span>an Lamothe at the Military Times blog BattleRattle <a href="http://militarytimes.com/blogs/battle-rattle/2010/10/19/marines-conducting-pakistani-flood-relief-avoid-attacks/">pointed out</a>
 a great little anecdote on the defensive benefits of soft power, in 
this case during the US military’s disaster relief in Pakistan:</p>
<blockquote><p>After landing in one remote spot of Kohistan, in a 
designated Provincially Administered Tribal Area, the Pakistani leader 
of a flight ordered a hasty evacuation after less than a minute on the 
ground, before any aid could be delivered. The order came after local 
tribesmen warned him and the security detail that Taliban or other armed
 men were hiding behind a hill near the landing spot, apparently waiting
 for offloading to begin to launch an ambush.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time we have seen civilians protecting US 
servicemen conducting hearts and minds operations. Last month, Roger 
Cranse <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/13/the_hearts_and_minds_guys?print=yes&amp;hidecomments=yes&amp;page=full">described a similar event</a> during a hearts and minds operation during the Vietnam War:</p>
<blockquote><p>The villagers told us no one had been killed or injured 
by the errant gunfire; three houses, however, were destroyed. We 
promised to bring aluminum roofing sheets, bulgur wheat, rice, old 
clothes from Catholic Relief Services, CARE packages — the usual stuff. 
We got back on the chopper and flew over to Loc Ninh, where the main 
battle had taken place.</p>
<p>That evening back in An Loc, the provincial capital, one of the many 
spies working in our province sidled up and said “Got a report.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“That village today?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Squad of VC there. Said, ‘We want to kill these Americans.’ People 
said, ‘No, don’t; they’re just here to help us.’” The spy jerked his 
head up, grunted a half-laugh, and turned for the Special Forces club. 
The villagers had saved our lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, don’t read too much into this. Soft power alone is not an 
adequate defense in a combat zone. But, these case do provide (albeit) 
small-n evidence that there are defensive benefits to these types of 
operations.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>hen a civilian is injured or killed by
 US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, the victim’s family is given a 
payment as a token of sympathy, called solatia or “condolence payments”.

 condolence payments can be authorized up to $10,000. However, the 
typical condolence payment is $2,500. Condolence payments are paid from

would be welcomed by the governments concerned. …</p>
<p>In May, Obama signed a bill committing the United States to help 
arrest Kony and his commanders and protect the affected population. Now 
it is high time to act. Arresting Kony would reaffirm that mass murder 
cannot be committed with impunity. And it would show that, despite the 
difficulties in Iraq and Afghanistan, the humanitarian use of force 
remains a live option at the Obama White House.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like and respect Human Rights Watch, but Roth’s plan is 
ill-advised. Don’t get me wrong, Joseph Kony is Africa’s Hitler, but 
sending US forcing into an unforgiving jungle to find and battle a rebel
 groups with intimate knowledge of the terrain is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>After personally experiencing America’s failure in Vietnam and 
success in the Gulf War, the much respected General Colin Powell 
proposed a series of questions that must all be answered with “Yes” 
before the United States engages in military action. These questions 
came to be known as the Powell Doctrine:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is a vital national security interest threatened?</li>
<li>Do we have a clear attainable objective?</li>
<li>Have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed?</li>
<li>Have all other non-violent policy means been fully exhausted?</li>
<li>Is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement?</li>
<li>Have the consequences of our action been fully considered?</li>
<li>Is the action supported by the American people?</li>
<li>Do we have genuine broad international support?</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite massive changes in the international environment during the 
last two decades, I still believe with much of the Powell Doctrine. 
Despite some flaws, it is an excellent yardstick to measure the 
appropriateness of putting US armed forces and civilian populations at 
risk. So, when I saw Roth’s proposal I immediate asked myself what would
 the Powell Doctrine say:</p>
<h3>1. Is a vital national security interest threatened?</h3>
<p>Yes. While the Lord’s Resistance Army is not strong enough to 
threaten the governments of Uganda, Democratic Republic Of The Congo, 
Sudan, or the Central African Republic, the rebel group does pose a very
 real risk to the not-yet-established country of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Sudan">South Sudan</a>.
 South Sudan represents a major potential ally for the United States in 
the region and its survival is an important national security interest.</p>
<h3>2. Do we have a clear attainable objective?</h3>
<p>No. Roth argues the purpose of the US intervention would be the 
arrest of LRA leader Joseph Kony. However, there is no reason to believe
 his arrest alone would have a crippling impact on the rebel group. In 
fact, a “humanitarian use of force” to arrest him would, almost 
inevitably, expand into a full-scale counter-guerilla campaign against 
the Lords Resistance Army, an action history shows to have no clear end 
point.</p>
<h3>3. Have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed?</h3>
<p>No. The operation would likely entail deploying tens thousands of 
infantry soldiers to chase rebels with decades of local knowledge across
 terrain that negates the advantage of American airpower. This is a 
recipe for disaster, or at least significant casualties. For an idea of 
what I am talking about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306813866?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=humasecurevi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0306813866">I recommend reading up on France’s experience in Indochina</a><img src="conflict-health-posts-100-200_files/ir.gif" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" border="0" height="1" width="1">.</p>
<h3>4. Have all other non-violent policy means been fully exhausted?</h3>
<p>Yes. There is no reason to believe Kony is ever going to surrender on his own.</p>
<h3>5. Is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement?</h3>
<p>No. See question 2.</p>
<h3>6. Have the consequences of our action been fully considered?</h3>
<p>Not yet, but we cannot blame Roth for not doing so in the few hundred words allotted to him.</p>
<h3>7. Is the action supported by the American people?</h3>
<p>No. After a decade of brutal and arguably unnecessary wars, there is 
absolutely no way the risking of American lives to protect civilians in 
the jungles of central Africa is going to be supported by the 
electorate.</p>
<h3>8. Do we have genuine broad international support?</h3>
<p>Probably not. The international community supports the arrest of 
Joseph Kony in theory, but I doubt this support would continue once the 
US proposed what is necessary to do so: a large scale air and ground 
campaign involving tens of thousands of American soldiers, thousands of 
private contractors, hundreds of airstrikes, and maybe even airborne <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/obamas-agent-orange-health-diplomacy/">defoliants</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the use of military force is unjustified and 
inappropriate, regardless of the brutality of Kony and the Lord’s 
Resistance Army.</p>

<p>The daily stats offer some insight into the medical assistance

China. Need proof?</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span>id groups have asked the US government
 to make its aid supplies in Pakistan “white label”. Currently, US aid 
comes branded with big red, white, and blue logos (pictured above). 
However, aid organizations <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/06-aid-groups-concerned-over-us-branding-in-pakistan-rs-04?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dawn%2Fnews%2Fpakistan+%28DAWN.COM+-+Pakistan+News%29">worry these logos are putting their workers at risk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eleven aid groups, including CARE, Catholic Relief 
Services and World Vision, have sent a letter to American government aid
 officials asking them to reconsider their use of labels in order to 
protect aid workers from attacks by anti-Western militants.</p>
<p>“Branding in flood-affected areas must not be used as a test-case 
because the outcomes are likely to be fatal and impact on the 
longer-term ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver assistance in 
Pakistan,” said the letter obtained by Reuters.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have major problems with this. For better or worse, US aid is a 
part of US foreign policy. To remove the branding is to remove the 
primary benefit the US receives from providing the aid. “Positive” 
foreign policy actions, like aid and developmental assistance, are the 
only effective alternatives to “negative” actions, like military 
operations. Removing US branding neuters the aid’s ability to be an 
alternative to military action.</p>
<p>Furthermore, white-labeling US aid could have major long-term costs 
for aid organizations. Governments around the world are tightening their
 fiscal belts, and the United States is no different. The quickest way 
to put America’s foreign aid budget on the chopping block is to remove 
any chance that US aid can help achieve our national interests.</p>

Veterans Affairs, Boston University and Harvard University evaluated 103
 sets of identical male twins.</p>
<p>One in each pair had been exposed to trauma during Vietnam War combat. The other twin had not.</p>
<p>Fifty of the men exposed to trauma during combat were afflicted with 
PTSD. Those same men also experienced significantly more mental health 
problems than other war-fighters in the study who didn’t suffer PTSD and
 participants who hadn’t fought in Vietnam at all.</p>
<p>The implication is that a genetic vulnerability doesn’t trigger PTSD.
 Rather, the trauma itself is sufficient to cause the condition.</p></blockquote>
<p>The real question however is not if PTSD is real, but 1) how does 
combat exposure trigger it and 2) how do we treat it better. With 
military suicides increasing at an alarming rate, the answers to these 
two questions are worth their weight in gold.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>his week the Tribune has an incredible article from John Bockmann, a US Army pilot <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/1906/friendship-and-flood-relief-a-us-helicopter-pilots-tale/">recently deployed to Pakistan as part of the American military’s disaster assistance there</a>.
 US Army, Navy, and Marine helicopters all took part in the response. 
Some have cried that using the military in disaster relief is a threat 
to humanitarian principles, other fear it will shrink the humanitarian 
space. However, the simple fact is the US military did what NGOs could 
not, and saved lived. And maybe, just maybe, built some relationships 
along the way:</p>
<blockquote><p>After a few weeks of packing and planning, we were ready 
to deploy.  Full of excitement and some anxiety, I kissed my wife, took 
one last picture and was gone. We flew on a cargo jet from Alaska to 
Islamabad and the flight took so long I hardly knew whether it was day 
or night when we finally arrived.  Shouldering my gear, I headed to the 
terminal, weaving among Pakistani military and civilians on the tarmac. 
 A US Marine captain guided my group inside where we filled out 
information cards and relaxed in the cool quietness, surveying our area;
 smooth stone floors, low-slung furniture, and ceiling fans spinning 
high above.  The captain was talking to a Pakistani man who had been 
helping us.  Before we left, the man shook my hand and looked me in the 
eyes. “Thank you for coming to my poor country,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>I wanted to convey the depth of my feelings toward him and his 
homeland, but all I said was, “You would probably do the same for us” as
 I walked away.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Washington Post reported on Sunday that five U.S. 
service members have been charged with the premeditated murder of three 
Afghan civilians earlier this year. In addition to the coldblooded 
murders, the five allegedly kept photos and grisly souvenirs of the 
bodies and intimidated a fellow soldier who threatened to report them. 
Preliminary hearings in military court for the accused — who deny the 
charges — will begin in a few weeks. If convicted, could they be 
sentenced to death?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>According to the report, 89 percent of active duty and 
retired officers believe it’s crucial to emphasize development and 
diplomacy initiatives in addition to military strength. Eighty-three 
percent of those surveyed cited the importance of non-military programs,
 like food assistance and health, education and economic-based

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>or a month now I have had a growing 
pile of articles on the security implications (both good and bad) of the
 flood aid in Pakistan. To help clear my desk, here is some of the best 
articles in the last month on the topic:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/8/23/can-us-disaster-aid-weaken-the-taliban-in-pakistan">Can Flood Aid Weaken the Taliban in Pakistan?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Will providing more humanitarian aid help reduce 
extremist influences in Pakistan? Is it changing public opinion toward 
the U.S.? Or is it more likely that groups like the Taliban will be able
 to capitalize on the chaos created by the disaster?</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100914/FOREIGN/709139836/1002">Militants Offer Pakistan Flood Victims More</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Farmers in Layyah and Muzaffargarh, impoverished 
districts of Punjab, are being targeted by the militant and religious 
charities with interest-free loans in an attempt to broaden their 
constituency.</p>
<p>The Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik, said in August that 
militant activists found to be involved in flood relief would be 
arrested under anti-terrorism laws.</p>
<p>Militants have ignored the threat, however. Layyah-based activists of
 the Jama’at-i-Islami, which won the district in a 2002 local election, 
are offering cash loans to buy tractor fuel.</p>
<p>Similar offers have been made by the Khidmat-i-Khalq Foundation, a 
charity of the Jama’at, a religious political party inspired by the 
Muslim Brotherhood.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/08/08/98807/in-flood-ravaged-pakistan-army.html#ixzz10Fytlb3h">In Flood-Ravaged Pakistan, Army Gains Stature Over Government</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The sheer magnitude of the disaster would have tested any
 government. However, the Pakistani government’s failures — as well as 
the absence of President Asif Ali Zardari, who was in Britain and France
 as the catastrophe unfolded — have contrasted with the military’s 
ability to deliver assistance, with the army rescuing more than 100,000 
people.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.currentintelligence.net/agenda/2010/9/7/the-shrinking-of-humanitarian-space-in-pakistan.html">The Shrinking of Humanitarian Space in Pakistan</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Preventing humanitarian diplomacy by neutral agencies 
with groups to whom the US is politically opposed has drawbacks for the 
US as well. Under such circumstances, the aid organizations most likely 
to get access to civilians in those areas will be those funded by 
non-Western sources. In terms of public diplomacy, or what the US calls 
“hearts and minds work,” this risks wasting the opportunity for 
Western-backed aid groups to provide secular assistance and protection 
to the Pakistani people. This role is likely to be picked up instead by 
those elements of the (admittedly diverse) Islamic humanitarian sector 
who are least dependent on Western funding sources… including elements 
in Pakistan that may be using humanitarian “soft power” for very 
different ends.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/10/17/MNGJEF9G0M1.DTL#ixzz10FzRKkdt">Pakistani Extremists Take Lead On Earthquake Disaster Aid</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>But while international relief agencies are only 
beginning to arrive in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, 
Jamaat ul-Dawa has had boots — or, more accurately, sandals — on the 
ground for over a week.</p>
<p>Walkie-talkie in hand, spokesman Salman Shahid gave a tour Sunday of 
the group’s bustling field hospital overlooking the Neelum River. First 
he stopped by the operating theater, where surgeons worked in a 
makeshift room fashioned from blue plastic sheets.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/world/asia/03kashmir.html?_r=2">A Kashmir Hospital Is Witness to Conflict</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>For the hospital staff, the journey to work is a daily 
exercise in resourcefulness and courage. While the rest of the city 
sleeps, holes up in houses and stays away from windows that tend to be 
the targets of stones from protesters, the doctors and paramedical 
staffs of the Kashmir Valley’s hospitals must still report for duty.</p>
<p>Many doctors, who brave the gantlet either in their own cars or in 
hospital ambulances that serve as stealth commuter buses, complained of 
being caught in protesting mobs almost daily.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129635626">Aid Worker: Congo Rapes A Strategy To Force Exodus</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Melissa Block speaks with Miel Hendrickson, regional 
coordinator for International Medical Corps in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo. Hendrickson’s team has treated more than 200 women who were 
raped in rebel attacks a month ago. The area is known for its gold and 
mineral deposits, and attacks on villages in the area is frequent.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/article.cfm?id=2049&amp;cat=op-eds-articles">Humanitarian NGOs Must Not Ally With Military</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>We recognize that aid supplied by military forces can 
provide relief to people in need as can acts of assistance undertaken by
 individual soldiers or units moved by a sense of humanity. But this aid
 is different. It is not humanitarian assistance. It is given to reward,
 and it can be withheld to punish. It is often also linked with other 
activities, particularly intelligence gathering. By being subordinated 
to the military’s broader objectives, such aid is fundamentally 
different from humanitarian aid in its nature and intent.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2010/0909/UN-report-on-Congo-rapes-released.-Are-peacekeepers-bad-at-protecting-civilians">UN Report On Congo Rapes Released. Are Peacekeepers Bad At Protecting Civilians?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>MONUSCO was somewhat unfairly singled out in this case. 
It does not appear that its troops were aware of what was going on – 
they were guilty of not patrolling enough and not keeping their ears 
close enough to the ground. But this does not appear to be like Kiwanja 
in 2008, when more than 100 people were massacred within earshot of a UN
 Organization Mission in the DRC, or MONUC, camp.</p>
<p>But this report does beg the question: Why were all of these sensible suggestions not implemented previously?</p></blockquote>

 late 1949, things were looking bleak for Chiang Kai-shek and his 
Nationalist forces. Two million Nationalists had just fled from the 
Chinese mainland to Taiwan, and now the Communists looked poised to 
invade the island. Despite the fact that Communist forces had experience
 with amphibious operations and that a Communist invasion of Taiwan 
would likely have been successful, the operation never happened. What 
was the reason for Taiwan’s salvation? According to <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/1959/04/0008979">one source [gated]</a>, it was a waterborne parasite: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum">schistosoma japonicum</a>.</p>
<p>Lacking proper landing boats, Communist military leaders knew they would have to rely on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_%28ship%29">junks</a>
 to ferry soldiers across the Taiwan Strait. However, without access to 
proper port facilities in Taiwan the junks would not be able to get 
close enough to shore to disembark their troops directly onto dry land. 
The Communists’ solution was simple: the troops would swim from the 
junks to the invasion beaches. To prepare for their swim, soldiers of 
the invasion force were given months of swimming lessons in canals on 
the mainland. </p>
<p>However, unbeknownst to invasion planners, the canals were infested with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum">schistosoma japonicum</a>
 parasites. Soldiers started to get sick soon after the lessons began. 
Eventually, an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 Communist soldiers came down 
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis">schistosomiasis</a>
 and were in no condition to participate in the operation. This 
represented the core of the invasion force. The outbreak delayed the 
invasion six months and before the Communists could mount a new 
operation the Korean War began and American warships positioned 
themselves in the strait. The window of opportunity had closed.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>oday is my birthday. But more importantly, I have an article in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/">The Atlantic</a> on the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/10/09/the-blurring-line-between-militaries-and-health-workers/62961/">use of the military as a health care provider of last resort</a>. Here is a teaser:</p>
<blockquote><p>The growing role of militaries in health provision and 
disaster relief is not without opponents. Humanitarians worry the trend 
will lead to the politicization of aid, while defense establishments 
fear it will turn militaries into little more than armed Peace Corps. 
But these concerns misunderstand what’s causing the shifting military 
role. The spread of globalization, democracy, and human rights over the 
last century has changed how states treat armed conflicts and health 
crises, which have become more intertwined. In the age of terrorism and 
insurgencies, humanitarian disasters are more likely to turn violent; 
and military campaigns, such as the U.S. missions in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, tend to focus less on killing the enemy and more on winning
 over the local population, as militaries find that healing people is 
cheaper, more likely to win over locals, and less likely to inspire 
backlash.</p></blockquote>
<p>More on this in a later post, but for now, head over to The Atlantic and enjoy the article.</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>his week, the <a href="http://www.sabin.org/">Sabin Vaccine Institute’s</a> <a href="http://globalnetwork.org/">Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases</a> <a href="http://endtheneglect.org/2010/09/vaccine-diplomacy-through-military-to-military-relations/">published a guest post by myself on vaccine diplomacy through military to military relations</a>. You can read the whole thing on their blog, but here is the punchline:</p>
<blockquote><p>In many countries, the military holds a central position 
in the government. By developing programs to strengthen the vaccination 
capacity of foreign military health systems, the United States could 
benefit in two ways. First, increased institutional interaction between 
the United States military and those of foreign governments would build 
strong relationships between the two countries. These relationships, 
despite their technocratic nature, can be invaluable during future 
crises, offering potential avenues for dialogue and cooperation. Second,
 this type of military to military vaccine diplomacy improves global 
stability. Militaries weakened by infectious disease are less capable 
guarantors of security. This can make states more vulnerable to local 
insurgencies and political instability. By strengthening their 
immunization capacity, the militaries become more resilient to epidemics
 and thus more capable providers of domestic and regional stability.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>oday, I point out two recent articles 
on winning hearts and minds. While disparate in purpose and outlook, the
 two pieces highlight the good and bad of soft power influence.</p>
<p>First comes the <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/13/the_hearts_and_minds_guys?print=yes&amp;hidecomments=yes&amp;page=full">personal story of Roger Cranse</a>,
 a former State Department civilian attempting to win hearts and minds 
during the Vietnam War. Cranse’s account provides rare insight into the 
benefits of soft power at the local level.</p>
<blockquote><p>The villagers told us no one had been killed or injured 
by the errant gunfire; three houses, however, were destroyed. We 
promised to bring aluminum roofing sheets, bulgur wheat, rice, old 
clothes from Catholic Relief Services, CARE packages — the usual stuff. 
We got back on the chopper and flew over to Loc Ninh, where the main 
battle had taken place.</p>
<p>That evening back in An Loc, the provincial capital, one of the many 
spies working in our province sidled up and said “Got a report.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“That village today?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Squad of VC there. Said, ‘We want to kill these Americans.’ People 
said, ‘No, don’t; they’re just here to help us.’” The spy jerked his 
head up, grunted a half-laugh, and turned for the Special Forces club. 
The villagers had saved our lives. </p></blockquote>
<p>Second, is a worthwhile <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/foreign-policy/77050/losing-hearts-and-minds-development-and-its-discontents">piece in the New Republic by David Rieff</a>. Rieff discusses former USAID head Andrew Natsios’ critique of US aid policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Simply put, Natsios’s thesis is that the inevitable 
tension between accountability to the bureaucracy, as well as its 
appropriators in Washington, and good development practice in the field 
is now so skewed toward regulatory compliance that the U.S. global aid 
system is becoming ever more dysfunctional. Too often, Natsios argues, 
Washington’s diktat to its development specialists and its NGO and 
for-profit contractors “to measure and account for everything, and avoid
 risk” ends up fatally compromising sensible and effective action on the
 ground.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The American media has been full of declarations by U.S. officials 
that in offering assistance, as the U.S. military is now doing, to a 
considerable extent with helicopters seconded from the battle space in 
Afghanistan, there is a chance to lessen America’s unpopularity in 
places like the Swat Valley. But the Jihadists’s efforts not only dwarf 
those of Pakistan’s government, which has conformed to the pattern of 
corruption, indifference, and, when finally mobilized, incompetence, for
 which it is justly notorious, but America’s as well.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>ver at The New Ledger, <a href="http://nextnavy.com/">Craig Hooper</a> and myself have a <a href="http://newledger.com/2010/09/a-second-great-white-fleet/">new piece advocating for the creation of a second Great White Fleet</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States can do anything, but it cannot do 
everything. With our attention and resources already committed near 
capacity around the globe, the U.S. needs strong partnerships to build a
 more resilient, secure world. A new Great White Fleet is an opportunity
 to build the relationships we need to face the threats of the coming 
decades. Describing the original Great White Fleet before its departure,
 U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Robley Evans proclaimed that “we are ready at 
the drop of a hat for a feast, a frolic, or a fight”. In the 21st 
century, the world knows America can fight. It is time we remind the 
world we can feast and frolic as well.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>oreign Policy recently published a worthwhile article on humanitarian neutrality in Afghanistan. Somewhat erroneously titled “<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/17/cozying_up_to_the_taliban?page=0,0">Cozying Up to the Taliban</a>“,
 the piece is really a discussion of why and how NGOs negotiate for 
their neutrality with insurgent groups in the war-torn country. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The reason for the cooperation is to keep aid workers 
and their services safe, says Laurent Saillard, director of the Agency 
Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief. It’s an uphill battle, he told me, 
with national NGO staff are kidnapped at a rate of “10, 15, 20 people” 
per week. “So you can guess [that] there are a lot of NGOs in contact 
with the Taliban,” he said. The Taliban has largely opened the door to 
NGOs; whereas insurgents from abroad, including Iran, Chechnya, Saudi 
Arabia, and Uzbekistan have a “reputation [of being] much tougher when 
it comes to foreigners.”</p>
<p>Well-known humanitarian groups such as Médicins Sans Frontières (MSF)
 have all negotiated for their protection. And recently, the relative 
strength and organization of the Taliban has made it an easier task. 
Michiel Hofman, the organization’s country representative, met face to 
face with Taliban commanders in the chain of command between March and 
May 2009 in order to re-establish the organization’s presence in 
Afghanistan, he told me in an interview.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The article is one more data point that the <a href="http://humanrights.change.org/blog/view/humanitarian_neutrality_isnt_dead_because_it_never_existed">blanket humanitarian neutrality is a myth</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>or those that do not know, I currently live in South Africa. For the last three weeks, the country has experienced a <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/south-africa/100903/south-africa-strike-grinds-country-halt">strike of 1.3 million government workers</a>,
 including nurses and hospital workers. The effect on the public health 
care system has been devastating. Since the strike started, all 
government hospitals are either closed or barely functioning. 
Furthermore, newborn patients in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-09-02/south-africa-s-labor-unions-reject-revised-wage-offer.html">intensive care units were abandoned by their nurses</a> and one non-striking <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/nurse_badly_beaten_by_strikers_1_679564">nurse was beaten and stabbed by protestors</a>. There is no end to the strike in sight.</p>
<p>In response, the South African government deployed its health workers of last resort: the military. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11057690">South
 African Military Health Service (which interestingly is its own branch 
of the South African military) has sent medical personnel to 37 
hospitals around the country</a>. These military doctors and health 
workers are charged with keeping at least some public emergency services
 open. This is not the first time a nation has relied on the military to
 provide health service during strikes. In February, Nigeria <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201003010131.html">deployed Army and Air Force doctors and nurses during a state hospital strike</a>.
 While far from ideal, the world’s militaries provide a valuable but 
under-recognized service as the health care providers of last resort.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">Y</span>esterday, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) <a href="http://www.andrewerickson.com/2010/08/chinese-hospital-ship-%E2%80%9Cpeace-ark%E2%80%9D-sets-sail-for-indian-ocean-gulf-of-aden-africa-to-provide-medical-assistance-exchange/">deployed</a> its first purpose-built hospital ship on an 87 day medical diplomacy mission. The 10,000 ton vessel, called Peace Ark, will “<a href="http://www.gov.cn/english/2010-08/31/content_1692806.htm">provide medical treatment to soldiers and officers serving in the Gulf of Aden</a>”, “<a href="http://www.gov.cn/english/2010-08/31/content_1692806.htm">provide
 medical treatment to people in five African and Asian countries – 
Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, the Seychelles and Bangladesh</a>”, and “<a href="http://www.gov.cn/english/2010-08/31/content_1692806.htm">conduct various exchange programs with medical workers in the countries the ship calls at</a>”.</p>
<p>This launch marks a major soft power first for Beijing. The cruise is
 almost certainly inspired by the successes of similar US medical 
stability operations conducted by USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy. However, 
it is important to note that, like US hospital ships, Peace Ark is a 
dual-use vessel. America’s hospital ships were originally designed and 
built to provide medical care during large scale military operations. 
Likewise, Peace Ark is exactly the type of ship needed during a major 
amphibious action against Taiwan.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> am an unbashed fan of human security researcher and University of Massachusetts-Amherst Associate Professor <a href="http://people.umass.edu/charli/">Charli Carpenter</a>.
 In early August, she once again demonstrated why I hold her in such 
high regard. In an op-ed on the Wikileaks war data, Professor Carpenter 
makes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/opinion/12iht-edcarpenter.html"> probably the most reasoned and intelligent argument for the need for new rules of war</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The humanitarian consequences of such attacks showcase 
the absence of clear-cut rules on what it means in practice to minimize 
civilian casualties. An updated set of rules may be needed to fit the 
nature of today’s wars if a better rate of civilian protection is to be 
achieved.</p>
<p>Such rules would need to be worked out by states, but nongovernmental
 organizations and legal experts have plenty of ideas about what they 
could look like. For example, governments and human rights organization 
should re-evaluate what exactly constitutes “excessive” civilian 
casualties or “all feasible precautions” and determine whether some 
limits might shrink the gray area between “unfortunate” and “unlawful.” 
Landmine Action, for example, has called on states to curtail the use of
 explosive weapons in urban areas. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Today, war crimes by governments are declining in part because the 
original rules were improved upon and are working to influence military 
doctrine — even among those governments who never formally signed onto 
them. But as the Afghan war logs suggest, collateral damage by 
governments may be increasing in international wars in part because of 
the absence of such clear-cut rules. It’s time for this to change.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">P</span>reviously, I discussed the <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/the-guinea-worm-ceasefire/">Guinea Worm Ceasefire</a>
 in Sudan. This ceasefire during the Sudanese civil war allowed public 
health programs to operate in areas of fighting. While temporary, the 
ceasefire improved the health of the civilian population and helped 
establish a non-governmental health infrastructure capable of reducing 
the disease’s prevalence. However, the Guinea Worm Ceasefire is just one
 example of health related cooperation between belligerents.</p>
<p>Government and NGO health workers  in Afghanistan face great risks. 
You do not need to look far to find proof. Earlier this month a team of 
NGO health workers was executed by Taliban forces in the north of the 
country. However, for some health workers conducting polio vaccinations 
in Afghanistan, <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=86136">safety comes in the form of a one page letter</a>. The letter is an endorsement of the antipolio campaign and is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB126298998237022117.html">signed by Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar</a>.</p>
<p>The letter, rarely discussed by the media or politicians, is the 
brainchild of Dr. Tahir Mir, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) head 
of the polio-eradication campaign in Afghanistan.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In mid-2007, when Dr. Mir first asked for a Taliban 
letter of support, polio teams encountered growing difficulties in 
accessing insurgent-held areas.</p>
<p>At the time, some vaccinators were beaten up and their rosters 
snatched by local Taliban, because the teams’ frequent home visits and 
detailed documentation of who lives where aroused suspicions that the 
health workers were spying on militants. “But now, if they have any 
problems, they just show the Taliban letter, and it works,” says 
Khushhal Zaman, the WHO’s polio-eradication team leader for four eastern
 Afghan provinces, including Laghman.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Dr. Mir says that, because of the rise in insurgent activities in the
 previously safe northern Afghanistan, vaccination workers now must 
carry the Taliban letter in northern provinces such as Kunduz and 
Baghlan, in addition to the south and the east.</p>
<p>In the insurgent-dominated areas, it’s the Taliban who select the 
local vaccination teams and their supervisors. These Taliban-appointed 
vaccinators then receive the vaccine and the documentation from 
government health offices, and report back the results once the round is
 over.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the WHO is not allowed to talk to the Taliban direct (due to 
the United Nations blacklist), Dr. Mir used the International Red Cross 
and Red Crescent (ICRC) as an intermediary. As per their neutrality 
mandate, ICRC maintains a strong relationship with the Taliban and even <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/taliban-combat-medicine-icrc-neutrality/">provides insurgents with first aid training and medical support</a>.</p>
<p>The Taliban has provided a new letter of endorsement for every polio 
campaign, ten times in 2009 alone. While this letter is not a path to 
peace, it is a rare form of cooperation between the Afghan government, 
the IGO community, and the Taliban.</p>

 the US military’s role in flood relief efforts in Pakistan. As a 
service to Conflict Health readers, here is a roundup of the best

<h3><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-american-aid-20100821,0,6446657.story">U.S. aims to wash away hatred in Pakistan flood relief work</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>As the U.S. carries out rescue missions and pours 
millions of dollars of relief into flood-ravaged Pakistan, Washington 
hopes the aid will chip away at the deep hatred and mistrust that many 
Pakistanis have for America. Though the two nations’ governments remain 
allies in the fight against terrorism, Pakistanis have long viewed the

<blockquote><p>That stated, the ability to conduct humanitarian 
assistance has a long and honorable history in the US military and has 
its place. Taking six-weeks to help people suffering from water-born

Most who are in danger of dying now will be dead by the time the ARG/MEU

“our” job to save every soul in danger across the world?  A Pakistani 
whose village is much better off than the homeless refugees of Darfur 
who are walking among the uncounted dead.  Where, and at what 
cost-point, do you say, “enough.”  When do the actions of a Republic

heavy flooding in many areas of Pakistan. The United Nations estimates 
more than 20 million people are affected. In response the disaster, the 
United States has launched a civilian and military relief effort in the

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he ongoing flooding in Pakistan is one
 more devastating burden that must be carried by that country. On top of
 terrorism, political instability, and economic hardship, the Pakistani 
people and the state must rebuild the lives and livelihoods of tens of 
millions of people affected by the flood waters.</p>
<p>Among defense and Pakistan experts, there has been much discussion 
over the strategic implications of the floods on the country and NATO’s 
war effort in neighboring Afghanistan. The consensus is not optimistic. 
In responding to the disaster, Pakistan’s civilian government has been 
perceived as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66T3RS20100802">largely incapable of providing meaningful assistance</a>,
 leaving the military as the last apparatus of the state (though largely
 independent of the state) with the ability to respond to the disaster. 
It is in fact charities affiliated with <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/08/pak-prez-taliban-is-winning-hearts-and-minds/?utm_source=co2hog">Islamist militant groups that are in one of the best position to help</a>,
 and therefore win over, the Pakistani population. These charities were 
on the ground well before any major national or international response.</p>
<p>The war in Afghanistan is not going well. Protected by safe havens in
 Pakistan’s frontier provinces, the Taliban and other groups continue to
 undermine Afghan government after close to a decade of war against the 
United States and its allies. Despite new strategies and technologies, 
the blunt truth is that victory seems as far away as ever.</p>
<p>We cannot invade the frontier provinces; we cannot chase the Taliban across Pakistan’s hills in some <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1998036,00.html">Faulknerian quest</a>. However, perhaps we can suffocate Islamist sympathies by helping Pakistan rebuild. Let us <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/08/4-reasons-us-led-force-in-afghanistan-should-aid-pakistani-floods/60794/">strengthen America’s efforts</a>
 in Afghanistan by charging USAID to do in Pakistan what it does best: 
providing economic and humanitarian assistance. Even without considering
 the strategic implications, the disaster in Pakistan deserves a relief 
and rebuilding effort of Herculean proportions. Add the opportunity to 
strangle Islamist support through helping a country rebuild and there is
 a clear and present need for a sizable, sustained American relief 
effort.</p>
<p>Islamist charities, despite their current prestige do not have the 
resources for a long term, wide-scale effort. They can provide temporary
 food and shelter, but they cannot rebuild a country. We can. America 
has an opportunity to win Pakistani hearts and minds through helping 
reconstruct schools, roads, bridges, and hospitals. Together with NGO 
partners, we can provide some of the resources Pakistan will need to get
 back on its feet. After the flooding, the Islamist charities were there
 first, let us make sure we are there the most and last.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>or years, there has been one constant challenge for United States and coalition military operations in Afghanistan: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/calls-for-more-helicopters-as-afghanistan-and-iraq-toll-hits-300-1020493.html">insufficient rotary wing aircraft</a>.
 Rotary assets ferry supplies, carry soldiers, and provide air support 
all over the country. Put bluntly, helicopters are the 
coin-of-the-realm: the more you have, the more you can do. And we do not
 have enough.</p>
<p>There has been numerous attempts to rectify the dearth of rotary assets, <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/08/cias-black-helicopters-land-in-court/">including some rather shady ones</a>. However, helicopters still remain one of the most needed military resources in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In response to the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iR-R0qKd-zWZJLGgZyrn48rzGugQ">deadly flooding in Pakistan</a>,
 the Pakistani military reassigned some helicopters from combat 
operations to disaster relief. For its part, the US military provided 
six helicopters to the relief efforts, however it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/09/AR2010080905769.html">kept the bulk of its rotary wing assets in Afghanistan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s a question of risk mitigation,” the official said. 
“Helicopter lift is critical to the mission” in Afghanistan, where road 
transport is difficult and dangerous, he said. “It’s not like we have a 
great surplus of helicopters in theater that are not engaging.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This answer has satisfied <a href="http://blog.psaonline.org/2010/08/11/where-are-the-helicopters/">neither</a> the Pakistanis or some <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/obamas-pakistan-katrina-h_b_678755.html">pundits</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would also be absurd to say that we can’t afford to 
divert resources from the war to emergency flood relief, when much of 
the story told on behalf of the war is 1) all about “winning hearts and 
minds” and 2) all about Pakistan; and when the press is reporting that 
Islamist militants in Pakistan are cleaning our clocks in the battle for
 flood relief.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, it looks like the Marines are coming to the rescue. Today it was announced that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jVPbub8VOAC4aCFDofQWcUJods0AD9HHHUKO0">USS Peleliu is waiting in international waters off the coast of Karachi with 19 Marine helicopters</a>
 available for disaster relief missions. These aircraft will allow the 
six US helicopters mentioned above to return to combat operations.</p>
<p>This week’s row over the allocation of helicopters highlights a 
greater and largely undiscussed issue. In a world of finite resources, 
when the needs of hard power and soft power conflict over an asset, 
which takes priority? </p>
<p>The answer is not as straightforward as you think. <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/dod-instruction-6000-16/">Department Of Defense Instruction 6000.16 states</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is DoD policy that: a. MSOs [editor: Medical 
Stability Operations] are a core U.S. military mission that the DoD 
Military Health System (MHS) shall be prepared to conduct throughout all
 phases of conflict and across the range of military operations, 
including in combat and non-combat environments. <strong>MSOs shall be 
given priority comparable to combat operations and be explicitly 
addressed and integrated across all MHS activities including</strong> doctrine, organization, training, education, exercises, <strong>materiel</strong>,
 leadership, personnel, facilities, and planning in accordance with 
Reference (b).” [Emphasis: Mine] (Department Of Defense 6000.16, 1)</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, under 6000.16, in at least one part of the US military, soft 
power should be given the same access to resources as hard power 
operations. The reality is that the allocation of resources must be a 
compromise between soft and hard power roles, balancing the benefits of 
having a resource in one role with the costs of lacking a resource in 
another. That is the very essence of strategy.</p>

Afghanistan 10 days ago. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of 
being targeted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this new code of conduct signal a new, softer Taliban? Hardly. On Friday, Taliban fighters <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100807/wl_asia_afp/afghanistanunrest">executed eight foreign health workers</a> (six Americans, a German, and a Briton) returning from a health clinic in Nuristan Province.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their last meal was a picnic in the forest in the Sharrun
 Valley, high in the Hindu Kush mountains of northern Afghanistan. The 
medical team included Karen Woo of Britain and Tom Little of the United 
States.</p>
<p>Returning home from a three-week trek on foot to deliver free medical
 care to the remotest regions of the country, the aid workers — six 
Americans, a Briton, a German and four Afghans — had just finished 
eating when they were accosted by gunmen with long dyed-red beards, the 
police said.</p>
<p>The gunmen marched them into the forest, stood them in a line and shot 10 of them one by one.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>riday’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/world/asia/08afghan.html?_r=2&amp;hp">discovery of the bodies of ten aid workers executed by Taliban fighters in Badakhshan Province</a>
 highlights the risks faced by health workers in Afghanistan. Since 
being ousted from power, the Taliban have regularly attacked both 
foreign aid workers and Afghanistan government health professionals. The
 Afghanistan NGO Safety Office, a non-profit which tracks attacks on 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), has recorded over 600 incidents 
since 2007. However, the Taliban were not the first insurgency to target
 health workers and humanitarians.</p>
<p>Upon gaining independence in 1975, Mozambique inherited a small 
health system designed to provide care to Portuguese colonists in urban 
areas. After gaining power the FRELIMO (Liberation Front of Mozambique) 
government attempted to kickstart a country-wide primary health care 
system. However, only two years after independence those efforts were 
hampered the start of civil war against RENAMO (Mozambican National 
Resistance) forces.</p>
<p>Like the Taliban, RENAMO rebels were foremost a military 
organization, showing little capacity to administer territories under 
their control. Supported by the white regimes of Rhodesia and South 
Africa, RENAMO earned a reputation for incredible violence against 
civilians, government workers, and NGOs. RENAMO attacks on health 
facilities, roads, bridges, and government buildings around the country 
led to a widespread collapse of government health services. Between 1982
 and 1990 more than 48% of primary health centers were destroyed by 
insurgent attacks. RENAMO kidnapped, mutilated, and executed health 
workers and their patients. These attacks left over two million 
Mozambicans without access to health care by 1990.</p>
<p>Attacks on health workers are not random. The provision of health 
services, whether by governments or NGOs is a physical manifestation of 
legitimate governance. RENAMO’s attacks were part of a strategy to purge
 regions of FRELIMO services, isolate the population from government 
support, and exact costs on FRELIMO’s legitimacy as the governing power.
 The Taliban is employing the same strategy. Taliban attacks on health 
workers and humanitarians aim to counter the expansion of Kabul’s 
legitimacy in rural regions of the country. Every vaccination program, 
health clinics, and hospital is a threat to the Taliban. Thus, like 
RENAMO before it, these latest Taliban killing are the tragic outcome of
 a war over the governance of the state and the respect of the people.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast year I <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/threats-in-the-age-of-obama-infectious-diseases-foreign-militaries-and-us-national-security/">contributed an article</a> to an edited volume by <a href="http://threatswatch.org/tw/michael-tanji/">Michael Tanji</a>. I am pleased to announce that an updated version of that article has been <a href="http://www.currentintelligence.net/features/2010/7/28/infectious-diseases-and-us-national-security.html">republished in this month’s Current Intelligence</a>. Here is a preview:</p>
<blockquote><p>After the Cold War, attempts were made to expand the 
concept of security into new areas including economic, societal, and 
health security. The concept of human security has made particular 
headway. Human security was first posited in the 1994 United Nations 
Human Development Report and argues security must be redefined in terms 
of the individual rather than the state. The report lists a number of 
threats to individuals from famine to environmental destruction. 
However, while human security’s expanded definition has been useful, it 
is unnecessary in the present discussion. Infectious diseases are also 
threats in state-centric notions of national security. Diseases can 
weaken the capacity of militaries in developing states where Western 
nations have significant enough national interest to respond to 
internal, external, and regional threats. Securing these states would 
place additional burdens on resources, but the global risk from new and 
reemerging infectious diseases continues to rise in the 21st century, 
with significant implications for global and regional security.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I don’t say this believing that armed forces ought to 
“prioritize humanitarian concerns over tactical considerations,” as Dr. 
Carpenter suggests this trend indicates. I think these actions are being
 taken strictly out of concern that the US and Israeli militaries really
 don’t want the bad press, not that they are overly concerned about 
civilian casualities while engaging enemy forces. But I’m a cynic. I 
agree with the sentiment, but don’t believe it to be any admission that 
there’s anything wrong with the use of the Active Denial System or white
 phosphorus munitions. War will always be hell.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This represents a significant funding drop since 2003, 
when billions of dollars were allocated for “reconstruction” and 
“humanitarian assistance” purposes in Iraq. The United States (US) is 
now on schedule to complete its withdrawal of half of its combat troops 
in August 2010 as part of the Status of Forces Agreement to remove all 
troops by the end of 2011. Accordingly, there are rising concerns about 
the Multi-National Forces in Iraq (MNF-I) members’ commitment to 
financing Iraq’s humanitarian sector in the future.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And that’s where this gets complicated. Even though the NATO hospitals<br>
will report CONDITION BLACK, they will always make room for NATO troops<br>
requiring care; there just is not another option. Not so for the civilian<br>
casualties; in CONDITION BLACK, NATO will either refuse to collect them from<br>
the battlefield, or deliver them to the poorly-staffed Afghan Army hospital<br>
near Kandahar – the only Afghan Army hospital in the entire southern<br>
region – and not capable of complex polytrauma surgery. The result is<br>
that NATO is triaging patients based on nationality vice medical need.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Today, Conflict Health presents the fourth in <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/author/paulrextonkan/">a series</a> of guest posts by <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/Pubs/people.cfm?authorID=692">Paul Rexton Kan</a>. Professor Kan is currently working on his forthcoming book, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cartels at War: Mexico’s Drug Fueled Violence and the Challenge to US National Security</span>, from Potomac Books.</em></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">J</span>uly was a month of firsts for Mexico. 
 There was the first car bomb in the country’s history that was used by 
the Juarez cartel in an ambush against police. The first kidnappings of 
national TV journalists occurred when they were covering the 
unprecedented story of prison officials who allowed certain inmates out 
at night to kill rival gang members in the city with the use of prison 
weapons and vehicles.</p>
<p>In July’s month-full of firsts, allegations were made by the cartels 
involved that Mexican security institutions have been picking sides in 
the drug war.  Graffiti on a wall of a shopping mall <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/19/AR2010071901027.html">contained a claim of responsibility</a>
 for the car bomb also included the allegation; it read in Spanish “What
 happened on the 16 (street) is going to keep happening to all the 
authorities that continue to support Chapo (Guzman), sincerely, the 
Juarez Cartel. We still have car bombs (expletive) ha ha.” Another 
message was <a href="http://www.elagoradechihuahua.com/Amenazan-con-mas-coches-bomba,25606.html">aimed at the FBI and DEA</a>
 which was posted in an elementary school in Ciudad Juarez: “FBI and 
DEA, start investigating authorities that support the Sinaloa Cartel, if
 you do not, we will get those federal officers with car bombs. If 
corrupt federal officers are not arrested within 15 days, we will put 
100 kilograms of C-4 in a car.” For its part, the Sinaloa cartel was 
implicated in the kidnapping of several well known, national TV 
reporters in Mexico. The cartel’s intent was to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38504467/ns/business-media_biz/">force the reporters’ station</a>
 to air videos made by the cartel that implicated police in siding with 
another cartel composed of former enforcers who were once members of the
 Mexican special forces, Los Zetas.</p>
<p>As if to undermine the allegations that the Mexican state had been 
siding with the Sinaloa cartel, the Mexican military dealt a significant
 blow against the group when it killed one of the cartel’s top figures, 
Ignacio Coronel Villlareal, during an arrest raid in western Mexico on 
July 29. But violence might rise nonetheless if the Sinaloa cartel 
believes that the government caved into the threats from the Juarez 
cartel and is now siding with them.</p>
<p>Whether the Mexican government has picked a side as part of its 
strategy to bring violence under control or whether portions of the 
police and military have picked sides without the knowledge and consent 
of the government, the cartels clearly see the state as another “narco”.
 The result might be an August full of frightening and unexpected new 
firsts…and the continuing peril of the Mexican state.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n the early 1990s, campaigners for the
 eradication of dracunculiasis (guinea worm disease) faced a problem. 
While the global effort to eradicate Guinea worm began a decade 
previous, the disease still persisted in some area, and the largest of 
these remaining pockets was a warzone. In 1994, nearly 29% of all Guinea
 worm cases worldwide occurred in Southern Sudan, where rebels groups 
like the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) had battled government 
forces since 1983.</p>
<p>The guinea worm eradication campaign organizers originally planned on
 waiting for the Sudanese Civil War to end before launching programs in 
the country. However, in 1995 something remarkable happened: Sudan’s 
civil war was put on hold for four months. Why? So local and 
international health workers could eradicate guinea worm in the country.
 </p>
<p>Organized by <a href="http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc169.html">President
 Carter, the ceasefire was signed by Sudan’s leader Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
 al-Bashir, Sudanese People’s Liberation Army and the South Sudan 
Independence Army</a>. The so called “Guinea Worm Ceasefire” allowed health workers to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T1B-47WBYN5-D/2/cc6bedf21320344832ab966a9e7d935a">conduct eradication programs in 2000 Sudanese villages and other interventions.</a></p>
<p>While war returned to Sudan after the ceasefire, in 2005 the warring 
parties signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The agreement has

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n response to an investigation into 
the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza Conflict, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has 
announced that “humanitarian affairs officers” <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/21/israeli-military-gaza-war">will be assigned to combat units</a> at the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gxM65gROoRgDP6VFXb7UQbtsCBGQ">battalion level and above</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“According to the report, the new humanitarian affairs 
officers will have responsibility for advising their combat unit’s 
commanding officer and educating soldiers on the protection of 
civilians, civilian property and infrastructure; the planning of 
humanitarian assistance; and the co-ordination of humanitarian 
movement.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The move is one of a series of changes the IDF is implementing after 
civilian casualties during the conflict lead to an international 
backlash against the small country. Other changes include training 
soldiers to limit collateral damage to health systems and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gxM65gROoRgDP6VFXb7UQbtsCBGQ">restricting the use of white phosphorous munitions</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is doubtful IDF operations will be markedly different the
 next time around. First, unlike the United States military, the IDF 
does not have a career track for civil-military relations. Thus, IDF 
officers assigned to these humanitarian affairs position are not 
professionals in the tasks assigned to them. Second, nothing in the 
descriptions I have seen leads me to believe the positions holds any 
power to sway operational behavior. Third, it is likely that these 
positions will become dumping-grounds for commanders looking to rid 
themselves of low quality officers.</p>
<p>Until the IDF develops a respected and professional humanitarian 
affairs corp, I see no reason to expect changes in Israeli military 
operations in the future.</p>

<p><em>Today, Conflict Health welcomes a guest post by Captain Crispin 
Burke. CPT Burke is a US Army Aviator with assignments with the 82nd 
Airborne Division during Hurricane Katrina, Joint Task Force-Bravo in 
Honduras, and the 10th Mountain Division in Iraq.  He is a contributor 
to <a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/">Small Wars Journal</a> and runs his own blog at <a href="http://wingsoveriraq.blogspot.com/">Wings Over Iraq</a>.</em></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">E</span>very commander has his or her 
particular pet peeves. Mine revolved around immunizations and preventive
 medicine.  So much so that, to this day, I still carry around my yellow
 shot record in my wallet.</p>
<p>I used to persuade soldiers to get their regular immunizations by 
claiming that that wars have been lost as a result of poor preventive 
medicine, with infectious disease, poor sanitation, and immunizations 
crippling many an army. In fact, as I read last night, it’s quite 
possible that America might not have won its independence had the 
British actually took steps to ensure the health of their sailors.</p>
<p>Most Americans know about the American Revolution from grade-school 
history books, where we learned of thrilling battles at Bunker Hill, 
Trenton, Saratoga, and finally, at Yorktown. Yet, like many 
insurgencies, the war was not won on the battlefield; Washington’s 
Continental Army lost more military battles than they won.</p>
<p>True, the Continental Army owed much of their success to the 
strategic posturing of France, and overextension on the part of the 
British armed forces. After all, the Royal Navy in particular was far 
too small to cover the breadth of the British Empire. Tasked with 
protecting assets stretching from the home waters of the English 
Channel, the Carribbean, and the Mediterranean, the Royal Navy was 
hard-pressed to sustain a blockade off the American coastline, while 
simultaneously containing the Bourbons (then the ruling power in both 
France and Spain).</p>
<p>Although Britain successfully undertook a prodigious ship-building 
effort, her real difficulty lay in recruiting and retaining enough 
sailors to man ships-of-the-line, frigates, and corvettes. In October 
1778, over ten percent of the Royal Navy’s ships-of-the-line lacked the 
sufficient manpower to put to sea.</p>
<p>These difficulties were compounded by the fact that, though the Royal
 Navy drafted some 170,000 sailors into service, over 40,000 deserted. 
Furthermore, another 18,000 sailors–fifteen times the number which 
perished in battle–succumbed to disease, with scurvy being one of the 
primary culprits.</p>
<p>Europeans had known of a correlation between the consumption of 
citrus fruit and the prevention of scurvy since the time of the explorer
 Vasco de Gama in the late 15th Century. Later, in 1747, the physician 
James Lind formally documented the link between citrus and scurvy, even 
proposing a method of preserving lemon juice for long voyages. Indeed, 
in 1775, as war was breaking out in the Americas, Captain James Cook of 
the Royal Navy circumnavigated the globe without losing a single man to 
scurvy, relying on sauerkraut as a source of Vitamin C. Yet the British 
were slow to adopt regular Vitamin C consumption, and their naval 
operations suffered greatly. Nearly one-third of British sailors were 
hospitalized in 1779.</p>
<p>Scurvy hamstrung the Royal Navy’s operation. Upon France’s entry into
 the war, the British Channel Fleet was thoroughly unable to venture 
from their home port and provide a consistent blockade of the French 
port of Brest, a mere 150 miles from Britain. Scurvy caused horrendous 
attrition among the sailors of the Royal Navy, forcing the British to 
conduct their blockade from anchorage off the southern coast of England.
 This permitted a convoy of French frigates and troop ships, led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hector,_comte_d%27Estaing">Charles Hector, Comte d’Estaing</a>, to slip past the British blockade and land a sizable force in the Colonies.</p>
<p>In 1795, over a decade after the British surrender at Yorktown, Sir 
Gilbert Blaine petitioned the Admiralty to regularly issue lemon juice 
to British sailors. Within a few years, sickness in the Royal Navy 
dropped precipitously, with hospitalization rates dropping from one in 
three in 1779 to one in twenty by 1807.</p>
<p>A healthier force was able to leave Britain and seal off the French 
coast through long-standing blockades. It was the ability to stay at sea
 longer, according to British historian Piers Mackesy, which allowed the
 British to break the naval power of Napoleon.</p>
<p>Which raises the question: would we be living in a far different world had the British had simply taken their vitamins?</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n a continuation my plate-clearing 
strategy, here is a list of relevant research which has been published 
in the last few weeks. Loads of great writing material here, but alas I 
just don’t have the time.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66457/laurie-garrett/castrocare-in-crisis">Castrocare In Crisis [Gated]</a></h3>
<p><em>By Laurie Garrett</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Cubans want the United States to lift its long-standing 
embargo on Cuba, but any serious easing of trade and travel restrictions
 between the two countries may badly harm Cuba’s health-care industry.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://csis.org/publication/strengthening-global-health-preparedness">Strengthening Global Health Preparedness</a></h3>
<p><em>By Phillip Nieburg, J. Stephen Morrison, Emily Poster Hoch</em></p>
<blockquote><p>This brief analysis of U.S. roles in global health 
preparedness is not intended to be an encyclopedic review. The goal is 
more modest and preliminary. The authors review the recent history of 
health preparedness efforts; examine the key leadership roles played by 
the United States, including promising models for building capacity in 
partner governments; discuss important initiatives by the World Health 
Organization (WHO), nongovernmental groups, and other donors; 
acknowledge innate difficulties in strengthening global preparedness; 
and lay out core recommendations for a long-term strategic U.S. role and
 approach.

<h3><a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w16152#fromrss">The Effect of Civilian Casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq</a></h3>
<p><em>By Luke N. Condra, Joseph H. Felter, Radha K. Iyengar, Jacob N. Shapiro</em></p>
<blockquote><p>How are insurgents able to mobilize the population to 
fight and withhold valuable information from government forces? More 
specifically, what role does government mistreatment of non-combatants 
play? We study these questions by using uniquely-detailed micro-data 
from Afghanistan and Iraq to assess the impact of civilian casualties on
 insurgent violence. By comparing the data along temporal, spatial, and 
gender dimensions we are able to distinguish short-run ‘information’ and
 ‘capacity’ effects from the longer run ‘recruiting’ and ‘revenge’ 
effects. In Afghanistan we find strong evidence for a revenge effect in 
that local exposure to ISAF generated civilian casualties drives 
increased insurgent violence over the long-run. Matching districts with 
similar past trends in violence shows that counterinsurgent-generated 
civilian casualties from a typical incident are responsible for 6 
additional violent incidents in an average sized district in the 
following 6 weeks. There is no evidence of short run effects in 
Afghanistan, thus ruling out the information and the capacity 
mechanisms. Critically, we find no evidence of a similar reaction to 
civilian casualties in Iraq, suggesting insurgents’ mobilizing tools may
 be quite conflict-specific. Our results show that if counterinsurgent 
forces in Afghanistan wish to minimize insurgent recruitment, they must 
minimize harm to civilians despite the greater risk this entails.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="ftp://mse.univ-paris1.fr/pub/mse/CES2010/10010.pdf">The Health Consequences of Mozambican Civil War: an Anthropometric Approach</a></h3>
<p><em>By Patrick Domingues</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The consequences of civil war have been widely analyzed, 
but one of its aspect, yet important, remains marginally investigated: 
the human cost of the combats. Indeed, most of recent literature has 
focused on the numbers of dead and wounded, while little scope has been 
given to survivors’ health, whether they have been injured or not. Given
 that survivors are the ones who bear the burden of reconstruction, the 
evaluation of the health costs of civil conflict, is therefore crucial 
for the conception and the implementation of proper economic policies. 
This paper is an attempt in this direction. It aims at assessing the 
impact of the fifteen year long Mozambican civil war on the long-run 
health and nutritional status of adult women, measured by their 
height-for-age z-score (HAZ). In this perspective, two sets of data are 
used: the household survey data derived from Demographic and Health 
Survey (DHS+ 2003) which provides individual level information and in 
particular a set of anthropometric measures combined with an original, 
event dataset reporting the timing and location of battles and military 
actions that took place during this war. In accordance with the existing
 literature on this topic, I find that women who were exposed to the 
conflict during the early stages of their lives have, on average, a 
weaker health in comparison to other women, reflected by a lower HAZ. 
Using the Infancy-Childhood-Puberty Curves, a concept given by the 
medical literature studying the human growth process, I point out that 
this negative effect depends both on the age of entry into civil war and
 on the number of months spent in conflict. Furthermore, this study 
indicates that months of civil war before a woman’s birth also have a 
negative impact on her health highlighting thus the importance of the 
prenatal conditions. Moreover, as recent works have shown, a poor health
 status induces other adverse effects in the long run. All of these 
effects emphasize the importance of preventing civil wars and stopping 
ongoing conflicts.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123580171/abstract">Truth and death in Iraq under sanctions [Gated]</a></h3>
<p><em>By Michael  Spagat</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Sanctions applied against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq “caused 
500 000 children to die”. The figure, and the causation, is quoted by 
politicians and pressure groups. Is it justified, or were the statistics
 manipulated by one of the nastiest regimes on earth?Michael Spagat  
looks at the evidence.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he last few weeks have been brimming 
with articles relating to conflict and health. I had planned on writing 
about many of them individually. However, in a rare moment of realism I 
concluded to do so in a reasonable timeframe was impossible. So, here 
they are in batch form. I especially recommend my <a href="http://www.currentintelligence.net/">Current Intelligence</a> colleague Charli Carpenter’s article on human security.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.alertnet.org/db/an_art/55867/2010/05/9-091130-1.htm">Relief Agencies Urge Pakistan Army To Agree New Aid Rules</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Aid agencies in Pakistan have drawn up guidelines for 
their relationship with the military to protect their neutrality and 
enable them to reach civilians caught up in the army’s operations 
against the Taliban.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/d58db67c346ac704b093d4de45ca4080.htm">Humanitarian Space Easing In Afghanistan?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Humanitarian agencies are seeing promising signs of 
regaining space and acceptance from Taliban insurgents while attacks 
against NGO workers have reduced significantly over the past six months.
   Up to 1,200 security incidents were recorded in June – more than in 
any month since the fall of the Taliban – but attacks on NGOs by armed 
opposition groups in the first half of 2010 were 35 percent lower than 
in 2008-2009, according to the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office (ANSO).   
ANSO, which provides free safety analysis and advice to member NGOs, 
said attacks on NGOs had diminished due to their own enhanced security 
measures, and also because the insurgents appear to have stopped 
targeting NGOs.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.currentintelligence.net/agenda/2010/6/28/how-to-think-like-a-human-security-analyst.html">How to Think Like a Human Security Analyst</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been realizing that though I often say I look at 
global issues through a “human security perspective” it’s unclear to 
many people what that actually means. As Roland Paris pointed out years 
ago,  the term means different things to different people; in fact my 
own empirical research on what the concept means to global elites 
suggests as much. (The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs has a set of tools for doing human security analysis that are 
primarily development-oriented, for example, whereas many UN member 
governments continue to associate the concept with the responsibility to
 protect as well.) This ongoing debate about the term’s meaning may 
explain why people are sometimes bewildered when I make arguments “from a
 human security perspective” that don’t jibe with their conception of 
what human security practitioners are supposed to believe in.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,703871,00.html#ref=rss">Red Cross Hospital Treats Taliban and Children</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Some 200 people work here, including 180 Pakistanis. Two 
surgical teams operate and carry out amputations every day in one of the
 tents, battling to save people’s lives. The building next door, which 
has two brand new operating theaters, is almost finished. But there are 
just too many victims. Usually up to 12 new patients are admitted per 
day, but after military operations or attacks by insurgents sometimes 40
 seriously injured people arrive at one time.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://adrianbye.com/2010/03/03/how-i-almost-crashed-our-helicopter-in-haiti/">How I Almost Crashed Our Helicopter In Haiti</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>I got (ahem) a little nervous.  So I frantically tried to
 get the big box out of the chopper.  Unfortunately the box got wedged 
on the steering column which controls the entire helicopter.  I was 
pretty nervous about the guys running towards us, so I did get the box 
out, but almost rolled the chopper in the process.  Ryan fortunately was
 able to keep control of it.  He said later on a scale of 1-10 where 10 
is extremely dangerous that my little maneuver with the box rated a “9″.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am not going to press my concerns too far, because I know nothing 
about this particular operation except what is stated in the video. 
However, is a one-day (guessing) primary care visit the best method of 
health diplomacy? The video makes a good photo-op, but if the benefits 
of medical assistance operations are to be maximized, they must move 
beyond pretty pictures and focus on boosting the capacity of local 
health systems. Capacity building is both an appropriate public health 
intervention and an effective means of developing strong relationships 
between the United States and foreign governments.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n writing and conversation, I 
occasionally stumble across references to the risk of epidemics from war
 casualties. While never full explained, the argument seems to be as 
follows. In their wake, armed contests leave both civilian and military 
casualties. The local health system is overwhelmed caring for the 
living, let alone the dead, and so the bodies lie where they fell. As 
they decompose, the bodies spread disease to the living and in so doing 
create an epidemic. Is this possible?</p>
<p>No, <a href="http://icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/health-bodies-140110?OpenDocument&amp;style=custo_print">war dead do not cause epidemics</a>.
 It is an all too popular myth. As one public health expert said to me: 
There is nothing in a dead body that was not already there when they 
were living. Most diseases survive in dead bodies for only a short 
amount of time: two days for most diseases and six days for HIV. Plus, 
diseases do not gain new modes of transmission after their host dies. 
The risk of infection from corpses is small (mostly from bodily fluids) 
and limited to those physically handling the dead.</p>
<p>However, one caveat is worthy of note. A crude but effective form of 
biological warfare is the contamination of water sources by corpses 
(usually from an animal), thereby denying their use to the enemy. Why 
does this tactic work? Fecal matter from the corpse leaks into the 
water, contaminating it in the same way as stool from the living.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/foreign-policy/75873/armchair-experts">Is the Internet Making Americans More Willing to Intervene in Faraway Countries?</a><br>
</h3>
<blockquote><p>Kirsch argues that this can be a very good thing. As 
someone who has become a vertebral anti-interventionist, I cannot agree.
 I am far more sympathetic to Kirsch’s emphasis on the ever-present 
possibility of our being wrong in our understanding. But is this view, 
though true as far as it goes, finally not still too benign? My own view
 is that Baudelaire was in fact closer to the mark when he wrote that, 
“Any newspaper, from the first line to the last, is nothing but a web of
 horrors. I cannot understand how an innocent hand can touch a newspaper
 without convulsing in disgust.” The reason we do not share Baudelaire’s
 horror is that what the consumer of news is getting is not reality but 
that simulacrum of reality: spectacle. Guy Debord, call your office.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/25/the_long_emergency">The Long Emergency</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. administration counters that more money than 
ever is going into global health — it’s just no longer myopically 
focused on HIV/AIDS. The United States responded to the HIV/AIDS 
emergency a decade ago, the policy’s defenders say; now it’s time to 
take a broader, more sustainable approach that can eventually move 
patients away from their reliance on the United States. As congressional
 appropriations come up for 2011, battle lines are being drawn. </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/new-threat-to-u-s-troops-in-afghanistan-toxic-sand/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+WiredDangerRoom+%28Blog+-+Danger+Room%29">U.S. Troops Face New Threat: Afghanistan’s Toxic Sand</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>U.S. troops already face plenty of threats in 
Afghanistan: AK-47–wielding insurgents, improvised bombs, an 
intransigent and incompetent government. Now add a less familiar 
challenge to that list of woes: Afghanistan’s toxic sand.</p>
<p>The pulverized turf, it turns out, contains high levels of manganese,
 silicon, iron, magnesium, aluminum, chromium and other metals that act 
as neurotoxic agents when ingested. Combine the country’s frequent 
sandstorms and the kicked-up dust that results from helicopter travel 
with troops’ nostrils, mouths and pores, and you’ve got an unexpected 
example of how inhospitable the terrain is for the soon-to-be 98,000 
soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines fighting the war.
</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/25/AR2010062502160.html?sid=ST2010062703373">Endless War, A Recipe For Four-Star Arrogance</a><br>
</h3>
<blockquote><p>To be an American soldier today is to serve a people who 
find nothing amiss in the prospect of armed conflict without end. Once 
begun, wars continue, persisting regardless of whether they receive 
public support. President Obama’s insistence to the contrary 
notwithstanding, this nation is not even remotely “at” war. In 
explaining his decision to change commanders without changing course in 
Afghanistan, the president offered this rhetorical flourish: “Americans 
don’t flinch in the face of difficult truths.” In fact, when it comes to
 war, the American people avert their eyes from difficult truths. 
Largely unaffected by events in Afghanistan and Iraq and preoccupied 
with problems much closer to home, they have demonstrated a fine ability
 to tune out war. Soldiers (and their families) are left holding the 
bag.</p>
<p>Throughout history, circumstances such as these have bred 
praetorianism, warriors becoming enamored with their moral superiority 
and impatient with the failings of those they are charged to defend. The
 smug disdain for high-ranking civilians casually expressed by 
McChrystal and his chief lieutenants — along with the conviction that 
“Team America,” as these officers style themselves, was bravely holding 
out against a sea of stupidity and corruption — suggests that the 
officer corps of the United States is not immune to this affliction. </p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>oday, six suicide bombers <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/10485078.stm">attacked the offices of USAID and DAI</a> in Kunduz, Afghanistan. Three foreigners and two Afghans were killed. Twenty others were wounded. The Taliban <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp">have claimed</a> responsibility.</p>
<blockquote><p>The attack began around 3 a.m. when the first bomber 
exploded his car at the gate of the compound. Five other suicide bombers
 raced inside the building, where they began firing rifles, Mr. Omar 
said.</p>
<p>The five other attackers all eventually died inside the building, 
according to the governor, but he did not make it clear whether they had
 been shot by Afghan forces during a six-hour firefight or had blown 
themselves up.</p>
<p>“The building has been destroyed,” Mr. Omar said. He also said six 
American employees trapped inside along with four security guards had 
been rescued by Afghan forces. There were unconfirmed reports that some 
employees fled to the roof of the building during the battle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Relevant to today’s attack, two days from now (don’t ask me why I can
 see WashPo articles from the future) the Washington Post is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/25/AR2010062503838.html">publishing an article on how USAID workers are trained for Afghanistan</a>. It is a worthwhile read.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[The Iraq experience] reinforced the recognition that 
the military can’t do this on its own,” says Stephanie Sanok, a former 
Iraq policy specialist who served in the Baghdad embassy. “It’s the 
Department of Defense, not the Department of Defense and Much, Much 
More.”<br>
ad_icon<br>
Click here!</p>
<p>The “more” includes economic development, reconstruction and 
improving the ability of the Afghan government to meet its people’s 
needs, a process known as “capacity building.” Sanok, now with the CSIS,
 says, “In order to work yourself out of a job and depart a nation in a 
responsible way, you are going to have to transition programs and 
projects to local authorities, and you’re going to need civilian 
trainers to build that capacity.”</p>
<p>By the time the Obama administration took over running the war in 
Afghanistan, it was clear that both the military and its civilian 
partners needed more boots on the ground, and fast. But whereas the 
Pentagon could call up reservists and the National Guard to supplement 
its active-duty service members, neglected civilian institutions such as
 USAID had to build up their workforces from scratch.</p></blockquote>
<p>A special message to Conflict Health readers in Afghanistan: stay safe out there.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span>lways a sucker for a good war and health related graphic, I can’t help but post about <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10278643&amp;CFID=6452176&amp;CFTOKEN=f399ab025e7c9643-466AA5A5-B27C-BB00-0127F97D5261F6C2">Nightingale’s Rose</a>. The Rose is a graphical representation of William Farr’s mortality data on the Crimean War, drawn by the one and only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a>. The chart visualizes infectious disease (in blue), battle casualties (in red), and other deaths (in black).</p>
<p>While interesting, the Nightingale Rose is, for three reasons, far 
from my favorite visualization of casualty data. First, the wedges are 
measured from the center (and therefore overlap), however this is not 
intuitively derived from the graphic itself and thus can easily lead to 
misinterpretation. Second, as with pie charts, I find it difficult to 
accurately compare wedges of similar size. Take, for example, the August
 <del datetime="2010-07-02T19:39:23+00:00">1984</del> 1854 and November <del datetime="2010-07-02T19:39:23+00:00">1984</del>
 1854 blue wedges. Which is larger? Third, the area of each wedge 
represents its numerical value, however, since this is accomplished by 
increases the radius of the wedge, the representation takes on an 
exponential property. For instance, a wedge representing twice as many 
deaths as another wedge would not have twice the radius. Again, this 
takes away from the intuitive interpretation of the graphic. Not to say 
it isn’t still very cool.</p>

<p>Note: This is an old post from 2008 that was reposted by accident. 
But, given that I enjoy visualizations, I am going to call this a 
fortunate accident.</p>
<p>Edit: Special thanks to Michael for pointing out that the Crimean War did not occur in the year of Reagan’s election.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">M</span>y jaw dropped when Iran <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/iran-blockade-running-with-a-hospital-ship/">boldly announced</a>
 that it was sending a Red Crescent flotilla of its own to Gaza. This 
was going to be a high seas confrontation between Iran and Israel, two 
bitter enemies. However, the entire time I was thinking about the 
flotilla, a little voice in the back of my head kept saying: “This is 
Iran, the masters of inaction, beware”. But I did not listen. The 
Iranian flotilla was going to happen, and it was going to be a big 
freaking deal.</p>
<p>Now, it looks like I should have listened to that little voice. The Iranian Red Crescent <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/iran-aid-flotilla-to-gaza-delayed-20100621-ys5l.html">quietly announced last week</a>
 that two ships of the flotilla were being delayed due to lack of 
coordination and a change of cargo with “no definite” date of departure.
 The third ship of the flotilla seems to have to disappeared entirely, 
or at least is unworthy of mentioning. The real message is clear: the 
Iranian flotilla is not happening.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is one interesting sidebar to this story. On June 21st,
 media outlets reported a fleet of one Israeli and 11 American warships 
passing south through the Suez Canal. Later that day, Galrahn <a href="http://blog.usni.org/2010/06/21/roosevelt-diplomacy/">serendipitously discussed</a> the phantom fleet reports and the power of fleets to change national behavior. Why serendipitously? Because Iran <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/iran-aid-flotilla-to-gaza-delayed-20100621-ys5l.html">announced</a> the delay of the Red Crescent flotilla on the same day as the phantom fleet’s Suez passage.

<blockquote><p>Erlinder, seen above at a June 20 news conference after 
his release, was detained in Rwanda on allegations that he was 
minimizing the country’s 1994 genocide, which is prohibited under 
Rwandan law. Erlinder was in Rwanda to defend opposition leader Victoire
 Ingabir, who was arrested in April and charged with challenging aspects
 of the genocide. Controversially, Erlinder said yesterday that there 
might be enough evidence to show that more ethnic Hutus died than 
Tutsis. The accepted view is that of the 800,000 people killed over 100 
days, most were Tutsis who perished at the hands of Hutus.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/16/while_no_ones_looking_the_palestinians_are_building_a_state?page=0,0">While No One’s Looking, the Palestinians Are Building a State</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>But in Bethlehem, far away from the television cameras 
and breathless news reports, 2,000 Palestinian financiers also gathered 
recently at the second Palestine Investment Conference to quietly go 
about the business of building the economy of a viable Palestinian 
state. They discussed almost $1 billion in new projects targeting 
high-growth sectors, including information and communications 
technology, housing, and tourism. The politics of the conference 
represent a paradigm shift quietly taking place in the West Bank under 
the leadership of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and 
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, in which Palestinians are increasingly 
turning to the mundane, workaday tools of governance and development as 
their principal strategy for ending the occupation. </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://kevishere.wordpress.com/2010/06/17/war-and-child-growth/#more-437">War and child growth: Iraq &amp; WWII Germany</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>At the population level, childhood growth is often seen 
as a marker of health and the quality of the environment. When 
populations get taller in a few generations, this is likely due to some 
improvement in local conditions (better nutrition, less infection, 
cleaner water supply, etc.). Conversely, when linear growth declines, it
 is usually because local conditions (ecological, economic, political) 
have deteriorated. Two recent working papers illustrate how this pattern
 applies to war conditions.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20Afghanistan-t.html">Afghanistan’s Civic War</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The war Colonel Jones is fighting is, of course, the 
counterinsurgency war that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, commander of NATO
 forces in Afghanistan, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, regional commander 
of the U.S. military, urged President Obama to adopt during the fierce 
and protracted policy debate over Afghan strategy last year. Some of the
 president’s closest advisers, including Vice President Joe Biden, 
argued that after seven years of American neglect and the Afghans’ 
corrupt and incompetent governance, it was simply too late to fight for 
hearts and minds. But Obama accepted most of his generals’ advice, 
agreeing to dispatch 30,000 more soldiers as well as hundreds more 
civilians to the battle. Senior military and civilian officials in 
Kandahar use the same language Jones does in describing the impending 
effort there (no one calls it a “battle”): no kinetic operations, 
civilians out front, Afghans leading the way. NATO officials acknowledge
 that the plan is driven as much by the near impossibility of defeating 
the Taliban in a region where they are deeply rooted as it is by 
counterinsurgency doctrine. This is, for reasons of necessity as well as
 of philosophy, the new face of war in Afghanistan. Obama also said 
that, by mid-2011, he would begin to draw down troops — which means that
 Jones and his fellow commanders may have just another year to carry out
 a task that many policy makers and experts, not to mention many 
American voters, aren’t convinced can be done at all.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n June 9th, Tom Newton Dunn of the Sun <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/3005443/Taliban-using-HIV-bombs.html#ixzz0qPC6oXDd">claimed the Taliban were using “HIV bombs” against coalition troops</a>.
 The tabloid reported that Taliban fighters are placing syringes, 
possibly containing HIV, in the ground in order to puncture the skin of 
EOD soldiers searching for IEDs. Furthermore, the Sun posited that the 
syringes could become biological shrapnel if the devices were detonated.
 Do coalition personnel need to worry about contracting HIV from an IED?</p>
<p>Short answer: no. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/transmission.htm">The
 consensus of medical research is that HIV does not survive long outside
 the human body. This is the reason there has never been a reported case
 of environmental (i.e. touching a surface) transmission of HIV.</a> So,
 just how long would HIV survive in a syringe? Some laboratory studies 
found that the virus could remain alive for days. However, the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/transmission.htm">CDC points out that these studies used HIV concentrations far higher</a>
 than that found in the natural world and the specimens were maintains 
in precisely controlled environments. The mountains of Afghanistan are 
far from an ideal laboratory environment. In the real world, it is 
likely that a syringe of HIV contaminated blood would remain infectious 
for only a few hours. Additionally, if the device next to the syringes 
did detonate, the heat and force would in all likelihood kill the virus 
instantly.</p>

<p><a href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20100619/D9GED7K01.html">Great story</a> with a perfect ending:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The two soldiers were in Iraq together with a 10th 
Mountain Division artillery battery in 2008 when Sanders’ wife said she 
wanted a divorce, Sanders said.</p>
<p>‘It was mid-deployment. Things were getting pretty hectic at the 
time, the temperature was rising,’ Sanders said. ‘I would mainly call 
her to kind of vent. She was the only person I had to talk to. She just 
said goodbye.’</p>
<p>Sanders told Godding. Godding also noticed Sanders withdrawing from 
his friends, and recalls Sanders telling him in detail about ways he 
could take his own life.</p>
<p>One night in August, while they were at a forward operating base in 
Baghdad to rest and resupply, Godding became concerned enough to remove 
the firing pin from Sanders’ rifle. The next morning, Sanders tried to 
shoot himself, he said, but the rifle didn’t fire.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Godding, who received the Meritorious Service Medal for his actions, 
credited military suicide education for “making him aware of the danger 
Sanders was in”. If you want to learn more check out <a href="http://www.realwarriors.net/">Real Warriors.</a></p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n the 1920s, USS Lexington was one of 
the first ships in the United States Navy to utilize a turbine-electric 
propulsion system. It was believed that this new system would improve 
the survivability and performance of the aircraft carrier. Each of 
Lexington’s four electrical generators could produce 35,200 kilowatts. 
All together, the generators were <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2010/02/12/lexington-electric-part-i/">powerful enough</a> to fulfill the electricity requirements of a decent sized city. And, for 30 days that is exactly what she did.</p>
<p>In 1929, a drought in the Pacific Northwest crippled electricity 
production in the region, which was heavily reliant on hydroelectric 
power. The power shortage became so severe that USS Lexington was 
ordered to port in Tacoma, Washington and supply electricity to the 
city. For 30 days the aircraft carrier produced a quarter of Tacoma’s 
electricity. After that time rains restored the regions power production
 enough for Lexington to return to her regular duties.</p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-100-200_files/lexingtonpower.jpg" alt="lexingtonpower.jpg" class="frame" border="0" height="441" width="600"></p>
<p>The benefits of new engine were never to materialize in battle, as the “<a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2010/02/12/lexington-electric-part-i/">turbine-electric propulsion systems were more vulnerable</a>
 to shock damage than ordinary, geared engines, flooding of the engine 
compartment required time-consuming and expensive repairs, and the 
power/weight ratio of the turbine-electrics was much worse than of 
conventional engines”. USS Lexington was lost in 1942 at the Battle of 
the Coral Sea, <a href="http://www.dcfp.navy.mil/mc/museum/War_Damage/16.pdf"> partially due to her turbine-electric system</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever her weaknesses in combat, USS Lexington’s mission in Tacoma 
was a profound success. Moreover, her time as a power plant epitomizes 
the often overlooked civil assistance militaries historically provide to
 the countries they serve.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span>t the end of May, IDF soldiers boarded
 a flotilla of activist ships attempting to break Israel’s blockade of 
Gaza. During the boarding, nine activists on the largest ship, Mavi 
Marmara, died. In the wake of the deadly incident the arab street 
expressed outrage. Governments in the region were quick to exploit the 
anti-Israeli public sentiment. Turkey’s <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3899205,00.html">Prime Minister even suggested he might break the blockade himself</a>,
 escorted by the Turkish military. However unlikely, the statement 
garnered him a surge in popularity amongst his countrymen and 
Palestinian supporters.</p>
<p>Iran has also attempted to use the media attention to boost its 
popularity. Initially, Iran hinted at sending the Revolutionary Guard to
 escort convoys, but after that was rejected by Hamas the idea was 
dropped. Now, Iran has taken a different approach. Over the last few 
days, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/iranian-aid-ships-set-sail-for-gaza-1.296120">two Iranian ships carrying food, construction supplies, and toys left port</a> <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-14/iranian-aid-ship-parliamentarians-to-make-gaza-trip-update2-.html">in the latest attempt</a>
 to run the blockade of Gaza. The flotilla was organized by the Iranian 
Red Crescent Society. Iranian officials have confirmed that the 
Revolutionary Guard will not be escorting the blockade runners.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Iran has sent an aid ship to Gaza. In 2009, an Iranian ship carrying food and medical supplies <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/idf-confirms-israel-navy-turned-back-iran-aid-ship-headed-for-gaza-1.268129">was blocked from docking in Gaza by the Israeli Navy and from docking in el-Arish by the Egyptian Navy</a>.
 However, given new political climate after the last flotilla raid, 
these new blockade runners will in all likelihood make a more concerted 
effort to make it to Gaza’s shores, forcing Israel to again use a heavy 
hand.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> am still playing catchup with all the good stories that came out last week. I especially want to highlight Exum’s “<a href="http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2010/06/state-coin-2010.html">The State of COIN 2010</a>” and if you are in academia, Drew Conway’s “<a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2174">Ten Reasons Why Grad Students Should Blog</a>“.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2010/06/state-coin-2010.html">The State of COIN 2010</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>For counterinsurgency to remain relevant as an art, its 
practitioners and theorists must be its harshest critics. In effect, we 
need to join the Gian Gentiles of the world. (Or at least the Eli 
Bermans.) I have no doubt, for example, that a lot of what is in the 
literature on counterinsurgency is simply wrong. What assumptions, when 
tested by Iraq and Afghanistan, have proven in need of amendment? How do
 we need to examine wars against insurgents differently? Have we gone 
too “soft” in Afghanistan? Have we spent too much time fretting over 
tactics and operations and not enough time thinking hard about the 
politics? (My answers would be “no” and “yes”, respectively, to those 
last two questions.) What are we missing? And what are we too timid to 
challenge for fear of giving the more unreasonable critics (the baby + 
bathwater folks) ammunition? These are just some of the questions this 
blog and the rest of the community needs to think about.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/military-cant-keep-tabs-on-pill-popping-troops-senate-says/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Military Can’t Keep Tabs on Pill-Popping Troops, Senate Says</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>For years, Pentagon-backed studies have cautioned that 
more and more troops are being medicated with antidepressants, sleeping 
pills and psychotropic medications. But despite the warnings, it turns 
out that the data needed to reach any solid conclusions about military 
pharmaceutical use isn’t available. The military doesn’t actually keep 
tabs on the drugs its troops take.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Naturally, it’s hardly a sufficient condition, as we have
 to recognize that the demand for al-Qaedism or toleration of the demand
 for al-Qaedism is impacted by U.S. strategy. Public diplomacy is not a 
substitute for policy. But it ought to be a component of national 
strategy, and Malcolm has some worthwhile ideas in this regard. I can’t 
wait to read his book.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2174">Ten Reasons Why Grad Students Should Blog</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>As I thought longer about the vacant state of grad 
student blogging I wondered if it could be explained as a “they don’t 
know what they don’t know” situation. Perhaps by standing from the 
outside looking in, my fellow grad students simply do not know all of 
the benefits that can come from participating in an online discourse. To
 remedy this informational problem, and in an attempt to encourage more 
grad students to begin blogging, I present (in no particular order) my 
ten reasons why grad students should blog</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, amongst discussions of the 
flotilla and Afghanistan, there was some good stories on military 
medicine advances, especially from DARPA. Here are a few, with 
Ackerman’s drone article thrown in for good measure.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/05/extreme-medicine-gets-pentagon-push-human-trials-rushed/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+WiredDangerRoom+%28Blog+-+Danger+Room%29">Extreme Medicine Gets Pentagon Push; Human Trials Rushed</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh are working 
on some of the most promising Pentagon-backed medical research projects.
 Just last month, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen 
visited the university’s labs to see the science firsthand. And despite 
the looming threat of a shrinking Pentagon budget, he told them that “10
 years doesn’t satisfy any of us,” where clinical trials were concerned.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what this funding infusion is going to address. 
Dr. B.J. Costello, the lead researcher behind the university’s bone 
cement project, told Danger Room that the Pentagon’s contract is meant 
“to catapult us forward.” Costello’s program was expected to be in human
 clinical trials in 5-7 years. With the new grant, it’ll be more like 12
 months to 2 years.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2010/05/28/drones-and-civilian-casualties-and-studies/">Drones And Civilian Casualties And Studies</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>So today I got ahold of a new study that backs Fair. (And
 Obama, and Panetta, and Brennan.) Brian Glyn Williams of the University
 of Massachusetts finds that the drones in Pakistan have a 3.53 percent 
civilian-casualty rate. That’s 44 civilians killed out of 1,247 people

Read the whole post for the methodology. Williams concedes that no 
matter what, you’ve got the problem of the source data presuming an 
accurate distinction between “militant” and “civilian.” From my 
perspective, I respect the attempts at rigor here, but that basic 
problem appears insurmountable.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>One of the world’s deadliest pathogens, which gives its 
victims a gruesomely bloody exit, might finally be contained. After 
decades of unsuccessful research, a collaboration based out of the 
Army’s labs at Fort Detrick, Maryland has devised an experimental 
injection that cures the Ebola virus by targeting its genetic material.</p>
<p>The injection uses a novel technique, called RNA interference, to 
stop viral cells from replicating. Scientists packaged RNA snippets into
 particles that were then injected into four rhesus monkeys, who’d been 
infected with a dose of Ebola that was 30,000 times more potent than the
 virus’ most lethal strain, which already has a measly 10 percent 
survival rate. The snippets latched onto key viral proteins, and cured 
all four monkeys after a week of daily injections.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Pentagon’s far-out research arm has been zeroing in 
on the danger of mutating pathogens, and the corresponding problem of 
drug resistance, for years now. The agency is already funding 
tobacco-based vaccine production, a seven-day plan to thwart biothreats,
 and prescient viral infection detectors. And they’ve even set their 
sights on psychic medics, with a 2007 program that sought to turn docs 
into all-knowing illness predictors.</p>
<p>Now, Darpa wants the powers of premonition to wipe out viral threats 
altogether. They’re hosting a workshop for a new program, called 
“Prophecy,” that’ll develop methods to predict the rate, location and 
likely mutations of viral agents.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n May 17th the Department of Defense quietly released a new policy regarding medical stability operations (MSOs). The policy, <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/600016p.pdf">DoD Instruction 6000.16</a>, states that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is a DoD policy that: … MSOs shall be given priority 
comparable to combat operations and be explicitly addressed and 
integrated across all MHS activities including doctrine, organization, 
training, education, exercises, materiel, leadership, personnel, 
facilities, and planning …”</p></blockquote>
<p>And, that the military health system:</p>
<blockquote><p>“… shall be prepared to perform any tasks assigned to 
establish, reconstitute, and maintain health sector capacity and 
capability for the indigenous population when indigenous, foreign, or 
U.S. civilian professionals cannot do so.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/mar/23/joe-biden-obama-big-fucking-deal-overheard">big f#$%ing deal</a>.
 Traditionally, the military health system has played a secondary (or 
even tertiary) role in operations. Their goal was to provide the pointy 
end of the spear with top rate medical care, and little else. Now, 
6000.16 directs war planners to consider medical stability operation a 
tool in its own right, a carrot to combat operation’s stick.</p>
<p>6000.16 also addresses how the military health system must accomplish
 its mission. Namely, by supporting the local health infrastructure of 
NGOs in the area of operations. Warner Anderson of the DoD’s 
International Health Division (and a friend) put it well in a <a href="http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/05/military_mhs_deploy_052710w/">Marine Corp Times article</a> last month: </p>
<blockquote><p>“We have to do it smart and talk to the local health department and NGOs in the area … We’re here to make [them] look good.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To many people this might not seem important, but personally, it is 
music to my ears. For all their high-horse distain of the military, many
 NGOs (certainly not all) continue to operate with complete disregard 
for existing health care infrastructures. They do this in the face of a 
mountain of research stating that the lack of coordination amongst NGOs 
is a primary barrier to effective post-conflict health system 
reconstruction. Rather than building the capacity of the state to 
provide services itself, these “project-based” NGOs develop their own 
parallel health care system, diverting much needed financial and human 
resources from the state health system.</p>
<p>Despite its perceived inexperience at international development 
projects, Instruction 6000.16 proves that the US military has, at least 
on paper, a greater understanding of sustainable development than many 
humanitarians.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, 600 activists aboard six 
ships attempted to run Israel’s blockade of Gaza. IDF commandos stormed 
the ships 68 miles off the coast of Israel, killing almost of dozen 
activists in a botched raid. In the aftermath of the raid, both <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1283268/Turkish-navy-convoy-following-Gaza-flotilla-raid.html">Turkey</a> and <a href="http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=177635">Iran Revolutionary Guard (IRC)</a>
 have proposed sending armed escorts to protect a future flotilla to 
Gaza. However, few believe either Turkey or the IRC will follow through 
on their rhetoric and run the Gaza blockade.</p>
<p>However, now it looks like another faction in Iran might try. Today, 
the head of the Iranian Red Cross (not to be confused with the ICRC), 
Abdolrauf Adibzadeh, announced on <a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=129349&amp;sectionid=351020101">Press TV that Iran is</a> <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20100607/159330972.html">sending two ships with humanitarian supplies and a “Navy hospital ship” to Gaza at the end of this week</a>.
 I do not know of any Iranian hospital ships, but that is likely besides
 the point. If true, this sets Iran and Israel to face off in the 
largest naval confrontation in recent years.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>here is a growing popular movement in Lesotho <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/06/lesotho-independence-south-africa">pleading South Africa to take over</a> the small mountain-kingdom:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ten days ago, several hundred people marched through the
 capital Maseru and delivered a petition to parliament and the South 
African High Commission requesting that their country be integrated into
 its giant neighbour, which completely surrounds it. “We have 30,000 
signatures. Lesotho is not just landlocked – it is South Africa-locked. 
We were a labour reserve for apartheid South Africa. There is no reason 
for us to exist any longer as a nation with its own currency and army,” 
said Vuyani Tyhali, a trade unionist and initiator of the Lesotho 
People’s Charter Movement.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lesotho, one of Africa’s poorest nations, is surrounded by the much 
more affluent South Africa. The contrast between the countries is stark.
 In 2009, South Africa and Lesotho’s GDP per capita (PPP) was $10,100 
and $1,700 respectively. I could go on, but needless to say, on every 
measure of well-being South Africa scores vastly higher.</p>
<p>While the country faces a myriad of problems, from a crippled economy
 to a paralyzed government, there is widespread belief that HIV/AIDS is 
the source problem. They are likely not far from the truth, almost a 
quarter of Basotho adults (between 15 and 49) are infected with HIV. The
 negative impact of lost human capital from illness and death is a 
massive drain on both public and private coffers. Combined with its 
isolated geographic location, the time it will likely take to see 
significant improvements in the kingdom cannot be measured in years, but
 generations.</p>
<p>If Lesotho is annexed by South Africa, it will be the first modern 
nation-state destroyed not by invasion or revolution, but by infectious 
disease.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">E</span>arlier this month, the Economist reported that regimes from around the world had been <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=16167758&amp;source=hptextfeature">visiting Sri Lanka to learn</a> from the country’s successful hard power strategy against the Tamil Tigers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Louise Arbour, head of the International Crisis Group 
(ICG), says the Sri Lanka model consists of three parts: what she dubs 
“scorched-earth tactics” (full operational freedom for the army, no 
negotiations with terrorists, no ceasefires to let them regroup); next, 
ignoring differences between combatants and non-combatants (the new ICG 
report documents many such examples); lastly, the dismissal of 
international and media concerns. A senior official in President Mahinda
 Rajapaksa’s office, quoted anonymously in a journal, Indian Defence 
Review, says “we had to ensure that we regulated the media. We didn’t 
want the international community to force peace negotiations on us.” The
 author of that article, V.K. Shashikumar, concludes that “in the final 
analysis the Rajapaksa model is based on a military precept…Terrorism 
has to be wiped out militarily and cannot be tackled politically.” This 
is the opposite of the strategy America is pursuing in Afghanistan. It 
is winning a widespread hearing.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, as a side note, Sri Lanka’s strategy was not “scorched earth”.
 Scorched earth involves destroying items useful to the enemy during a 
withdrawal, not launching a military campaign with an open ROE (rules of
 engagement).</p>
<p>Second, more to the point, one wonders what lessons can truly be 
learned from Sri Lanka. Being an avid West Wing fan, there is a phrase 
from the show I could not get out of my head while watching the brutal 
final campaign play out on the island nation. A White House deputy is 
arguing for a new aggressive Middle East doctrine with a Congresswomen. 
When she challenges the new hardline approach he replies:  “They’ll like
 us when we win”. This phase is the true lessons learned from the Sri 
Lankan endgame. It is not about “scorched earth”, but that a quick end 
justifies the means.</p>
<p>Third, there is no guarantee the Sri Lankan victory is permanent. It 
would not surprise me at all if LTTE had reformed itself five years from
 now, manned by civilians radicalized by the Sri Lankan government’s 
tactics. This new LTTE would likely be more brutal and hardline than his
 predecessor. Sri Lanka might have won the war, but it lost the people. 
Ten years from now, they will realize the full cost of doing so.</p>

<blockquote><p>Today’s troops have a nine in 10 chance of surviving

vulnerable to infection, especially by Acinetobacter  — an 
(opportunistic pathogen) somewhat misleadingly nicknamed “Iraqibacter” 
for its prevalence in war-zone medical facilities. As Wired magazine 
reported in 2007, the bacteria has infected at least 700 American troops
 since 2003, and killed at least seven people exposed to it in military 
clinics.</p></blockquote>

 In amphibious operations, roll-on cargo vessels will carry on their 
decks pieces of heavy-duty “lighterage” — basically, motorized causeways
 — that they can crane into the water to function as a bridge between 
the large ship and landing craft. Vehicles drive directly out of a side 
door, onto the lighterage and then into the landing craft. The 
lighterage is simply an interface.</p></blockquote>

conflicts, one armed group at a time.</p>
<p>While de jure the Red Cross’ neutrality is based on the Geneva 
Convention, de facto it is based on the trust of rebels and governments 
alike. The Red Cross’ first aid training is more than just about saving 
the lives of Taliban foot soldiers, it is about building a relationship 
with rebels. It is about earning neutrality.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">J</span>apan’s neighbors have never been 
comfortable with the island nation’s quasi-Navy, the Japan Maritime 
Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). JMSDF is legally a civilian service, 
operating under the famous <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/why-japanese-does-not-have-hospital-ships/">Article 9 of the Japan’s constitution</a>
 requiring that “land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war 
potential, will never be maintained”. But, JMSDF’s de jure status has 
done little to calm the fears of several nations in the region who have 
nervously watched every move by the small organization (officially JMSDF
 consists of only 46,000 personnel) since the JMSDF’s creation in the 
1950s. </p>
<p>Recently, the legal limits on JMSDF have prompted <a href="http://www.warisboring.com/?p=5149">some Japanese defense observers</a> to argue for a turn to soft power. Now it looks like Japan might be doing exactly that. This month the <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/usns-mercy-deploys-on-pacific-partnership/">United States sent one of its two hospital ships, USNS Mercy</a>,
 on Operation Pacific Partnership 2010. This soft power cruise is just 
the latest instance of a new and growing mission for the Navy: health 
diplomacy. These humanitarian assistance operations started after the 
positive response to the Navy’s disaster relief mission after the Asian 
tsunami and gained an powerful advocate in current NATO Supreme Allied 
Commander Europe Admiral James Stavridis when he was Commander of 
SOUTHCOM.</p>
<p>US health diplomacy cruises have always included personnel from ally 
countries. However, this year Japan has gone a step further, deploying a
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Csumi_class_LST">13,000 ton Osumi flat-top warship</a>
 to join the USNS Mercy during ports in Vietnam and Cambodia to support 
Pacific Partnership. The 584-foot ship, JMSDF LST 4003 Kunisaki, most 
closely comparable with the US Navy’s Wasp-class amphibious assault 
ship. Kunisaki’s flat top allows for four helicopters (although some 
have claimed it was designed as a pocket carrier). Below, a well deck 
contains space for two hovercraft. Kunisaki’s deployment is, as far as I
 can tell, the one of the largest deployments of Japanese naval power to
 a foreign port since JMSDF’s creation. JMSDF port visits are uncommon 
in mainland Asia. In June 2008 a Japanese destroyer made the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1029034/Japan-sends-navy-ship-China-time-WW2.html#ixzz0os5qZrFa">first port call in China by a Japanese warship since World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Is Kunisaki’s port call the start of Japan’s soft power rising?</p>
<p>Update: More on this from <a href="http://www.warisboring.com/?p=5336">Kyle Mizokami</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>hile health systems vary in the role 
of the private sector, the priority given to primary and specialized 
care, the level of access enjoyed by citizens, and a host of other 
characteristics, most health systems (particularly in less developed 
states) share a basic structure based on a hierarchical organization of 
health care provision. Most citizens’ primary point of contact with 
health systems is usually through health posts, health clinics, and 
health centers. Health posts are the smallest facility in many health 
systems. They are staffed with one or more nurses and provide basic 
medical services to small communities. Health clinics are larger than 
health posts and provide a wider range of primary health care services 
including community health, basic diagnostics, ambulatory and emergency 
care, immunizations, and pharmaceuticals. These facilities are often are
 staffed by a small number of nurses with regular visits from a doctor 
shared by multiple clinics. The largest sub-hospital facilities are 
health centers, offering a greater range of primary care services than 
clinics and are assigned one or more dedicated doctors. In urban areas, 
health centers can provide care to populations of around 50,000 
(Westwood and Power 2007). Health posts, clinics, and centers are 
particularly common in rural areas, providing governments with an 
affordable means to expand health care access to underserved areas 
without the expense of a full hospital. In addition to providing health 
care, these facilities often play a critical part in health surveillance
 and data collection, from which health interventions are derived.</p>
<p>Minor urban areas are often served by a district hospital. These 
hospitals are responsible for offering a range of primary care services 
within their catchment area and are staffed by general practice doctors 
and other health workers. District hospitals are responsible for 
addressing the most common conditions. In addition, district hospitals 
often provide the laboratory services (e.g. blood and tissue tests) for 
nearby health posts, clinics, and centers.</p>
<p>Patients with conditions requiring specialized care are referred to 
regional hospitals. Regional hospitals are located in major urban areas 
and – like district hospitals – provide primary care for their local 
catchment area. However, regional hospitals are also responsible for 
providing secondary care services to large geographic regions. 
Therefore, in addition to general practitioners, regional hospitals are 
also staffed by pediatricians, surgeons, and other specialists. Regional
 hospitals often also provide other important health system functions. 
These additional functions can include health administration, medical 
education, and public health programs. A district hospital is “the 
powerhouse of the region” and a vital node in the national health system
 (Westwood and Power 2007, 215).</p>
<p>The heart of most health systems is located in the capital and major 
urban centers. These areas often receive a disproportionate share of the
 health system’s budget (Macrae 1995). In addition to having their own 
health clinics, centers, and district hospitals, these cities have other
 critical components of the health system. First, major urban areas 
contain the state’s tertiary care referral hospitals, housing the 
country’s sub-specialists medical professionals (e.g. cardiologists, 
oncologists, and neurologists). Not only are these health professionals 
often the sole providers of sub-specialized care in the country, they 
also have a central role in improving care nationally by driving 
research and innovation. Central hospitals are also key nodes of 
international partnerships with health professionals abroad through 
cross-national medical exchange programs and research projects. Thus, 
these facilities are a major source of knowledge, education, and 
capacity building.</p>
<p>Second, capitals contain the health system’s main administrative 
center: the Ministry of Health (MoH). The Minister of Health and his 
staff conduct unglamorous – yet critical – bureaucratic functions. They 
manage the distribution of resources and plan the organization of the 
health system. Furthermore, the ministry is the primary point of 
connection between the political leadership of the state and the health 
system. Finally, the organization is a point of contact between the 
domestic health system and the international health community.</p>
<p>The entire system is organized hierarchically. At the bottom are 
health posts, clinics, and centers. Patients requiring more specialized 
care or equipment are referred to district and regional hospitals. If 
these facilities cannot provide treatment, the patient is referred to a 
tertiary hospital. The number of facilities of each type becomes less 
numerous as patients move up the hierarchy. Liberia’s health system 
exemplifies this type of hierarchical organization. Before Liberia’s 
civil war, the country’s public and private health system included 761 
health clinics and health centers, 25 county (district) hospitals, and a
 single tertiary referral hospital in the capital (Joint Needs 
Assessment Report 2004). The capital also contained the Ministry of 
Health and the country’s only medical school (International Medical 
Education Directory 2010).</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>hat is human security? Here is a brief
 introduction. As the domain of security enlarged to incorporate new 
threats and actors, it increasingly overlapped with the field of 
development. The threats from poverty, environmental scarcity, famine, 
infectious disease and others began to be explored in both development 
and security communities. The growing intersection between the two was 
captured under the concept of human security. Broadly, human security 
formalized the belief that security studies should “shift from the state
 to the individual and should encompass military as well as nonmilitary 
threats” (King and Murray 2001-2002, 588-589).</p>
<p>The concept of human security first received widespread attention in 
1994 when it appeared in the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) 
Human Development Report (HDR). While, as Axworthy (2001) points out, 
the idea that populations have certain security concerns and rights is 
old, the HDR is the first major attempt to push the concept into the 
mainstream development, foreign policy, and security communities. Under 
the UN’s definition, human security constitutes seven security 
dimensions: economic, food, health, environmental, personal, political, 
and community. This broad definition addressed many of the main concerns
 of vulnerable populations, but also made operationalizing the term 
troublesome for two reasons. First, the expansive domain covered by 
HDR’s definition of human security could offer little information on how
 the seven dimensions should be prioritized (Axworthy 2001). Should 
governments, international organizations (IGOs), and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) focus their limited resources on public health, 
peace-building, or economic development? Is infectious diseases or 
income inequality a greater threat to human security? Paris argues the 
vague and expansive definition of human security was encouraged by some 
parties, who found it a convenient avenue to argue their area of focus 
(health, environment, culture etc…) constituted a threat to the security
 of individuals and deserved greater mainstream attention (Paris 2001). 
This definition of human was security was “slippery by design” (Paris 
2001, 88).</p>
<p>Second, the imprecision of HDR’s definition makes research into the 
human security of populations difficult. Allowing human security to 
include a set of vague dimensions, often with overlapping areas of 
concern, limits the ability to measure and study concepts in order to 
make policy recommendations. Under this definition “virtually any kind 
of unexpected or irregular discomfort could conceivably constitute a 
threat to one’s human security” (Paris 2001, 89).</p>
<p>King and Murray highlight the imprecision of HDR’s definition through
 a series of off-the-record interviews with politicians and government 
officials. The two authors find almost universal concern “that there 
existed no widely accepted or coherent definition of human security” 
(2001-2002, 591-592). The only consensus around the definition of human 
security seems to be an agreement to the lack there of. Before 
continuing, a selection of human security definitions is reviewed below.</p>
<p>While sharing the concerns of other scholars regarding the HDR’s 
definition, King and Murray develop a similar but operationalized 
concept. The authors propose that human security can be thought of as 
“generalized poverty”. In their framework, individuals experience 
generalized poverty anytime they fall below some established threshold 
in a central aspect of “human well-being” (King and Murray 2001-2002, 
585). In this way, human security addresses only the more at-risk 
individuals who fall below some acceptable minimum standard in a vital 
area. For example, a family could be considered impoverished if their 
daily caloric intake is less than the recommended minimum. The central 
appeal of King and Murray’s definition is measurability. With the proper
 data and a set of thresholds for each domain of well being, it is 
theoretically possible to construct a quantitative index of human 
security. For this purpose King and Murray propose a measure they call 
Years of Individual Human Security (YIHS) defined as “the expect number 
of years of life spent outside the state of generalized poverty” (King 
and Murray 2001-2002, 595). The disadvantage of this approach is that 
King and Murray’s concept of well-being suffers from the same problems 
of broadness found in the HDR’s definition. The authors propose 
including “those domains of well-being that have been important enough 
for human beings to fight over or to put their lives or property at 
great risk” (King and Murray 2001-2002, 593). However, it is clear what 
each of these domains are and how they can be measured. The selection 
and number of the domains would have a significant effect on the outcome
 level of generalized poverty.</p>
<p>Mary Kaldor’s (2007) monograph offers another conceptualization of 
human security. Kaldor posits a new definition of security that “is 
about confronting extreme vulnerability not only in wars but in natural 
and man-made disasters…” (Kaldor 2007, 183) and a new definition of 
development that goes beyond improving standards of living to include 
“feeling safe on the streets or being able to influence political 
decision-making” (Kaldor 2007, 183). Based on these new definitions, she
 proposes five principles of human security. First, human security 
places human rights above all else. Second, the local population must 
consider a state’s political institutions legitimate. Third, human 
security operations must 1) work with international organizations, 2) 
create and enforce common rules, and 3) focus on coordination. Fourth, 
human security approaches must be bottom-up and decisions must be made 
in coordination with the local population. Finally, modern conflict does
 not follow borders thus they must be examined at the regional, rather 
than the state level. While an impressive contribution, for empirical 
researchers Kaldor’s approaches offer little advantage over the 1994 
HDR’s definition. It is unclear how Kaldor’s human security could be 
operationalized, since it covers three levels of analysis: states, 
conflicts, and operations. Furthermore, the approach is simultaneously a
 set of threats to be addressed and ideals to be achieved.</p>
<p>Finally, Roland Paris (2001) argues that attempts to define human 
security suffer from an inability to separate causes and effect. 
Specifically, because human security has been defined so broadly, 
incorporating violence, famine, poverty, social marginalization, 
ill-health, and others it is impossible to identify a causal 
relationship between any socioeconomic factor and human security (Paris 
2001, 93). Instead, Paris proposes a definition of human security as a 
category of security research “concerned with military and nonmilitary 
threats-or both to the security of societies, groups, and individuals” 
(Paris 2001, 100). This paper follows Paris’ approach to human security;
 as a class of security studies examining threats to populations rather 
than states. Thus, while the theory addresses threats to individuals, it
 does not claim to offer any comprehensive measures of society’s 
vulnerability.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">C</span>ivil wars can create a boom for 
private sector health care providers. The destruction of the state 
health system during war creates a power-vacuum of health care 
provision, incentivizing private actors to establish themselves in 
domains previously the responsibility of the government. In Uganda and 
Colombia, this privatization was at least partially caused by a decrease
 in public-sector health worker salaries during the war to below 
subsistence levels. This forced health workers to supplement their 
income with private practices. The private sector boom was more 
pronounced in Lebanon. Much of Lebanon’s government health facilities 
were destroyed during the country’s civil war. The destruction created 
an opportunity for private health care providers to fill the void left 
by the crumbling public health system. After the war this system became 
the norm, with much of the population relying on a large private health 
sector and the government mostly relegated to the role of subsidizing 
the cost of private health care. Before the war only ten percent of the 
Ministry of Health’s budget was spent on caring for patients in private 
facilities, however by the late 1990s it had risen to 80 percent.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>hroughout their civil war, the 
Mozambican government continued to repair and build health facilities. 
During the first five years of major RENAMO activities (starting in 
1982), 822 health units were destroyed by RENAMO while 567 were 
reconstructed by FRELIMO. FRELIMO was, in a very real sense, racing to 
build health facilities faster than they could be destroyed or forced to
 close. The struggle between the destruction and wartime reconstruction 
of the health system is apparent in the number of health facilities in 
Mozambique during almost a decade of war, shown in Figure 3.2. Before 
the start of major RENAMO operations in 1982, the rapid expansion of the
 health system that started in the pre-war era continued to increase the
 number of health facilities in the country. However, after 1982 the 
total number of each type of health facility stayed the same or 
decreased as RENAMO attacks and collateral damage took their toll on the
 health system.</p>
<p>Along with continuing to construct the health system, the government 
maintained a vigorous medical education program during the war. From 
1976 to 1985, the Mozambican government trained thousands of health 
workers, including 569 medical aids, 818 midwives and maternal/child 
health nurses, 2181 nurses, 268 preventative medicine workers, 486 
pharmaceutical personnel, 406 laboratory personnel, 76 health 
administrators, 384 specialized nurses, and 1,402 village health 
workers. In addition, around the same time 6,242 paramedical workers 
were trained. The training of these health workers represented a 
significant cost for the wartime government. The result of this training
 program during the first years of the war was that the number of health
 workers in semi-rural and rural areas increased from 8,163 to 10,593 
between 1980 and 1984. While the number of health workers in these areas
 likely decreased as RENAMO stepped up its attacks after 1982, the 
numbers demonstrate the high priority the FRELIMO government gave the 
operations of the health system. In addition to training new health 
workers, the government invested in the improvement of its existing 
personnel. After the civil war made it impossible to train enough new 
health workers to provide child and maternal health, the Ministry Of 
Health started new education and training programs for the country’s 
existing health workers, including training medical technicians to 
conduct emergency obstetric surgeries and educating traditional birth 
attendants.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>eak government institutions can also 
negatively impact the coordination of international assistance in 
reconstruction efforts. The end of civil war often brings a surge of 
financial and technical assistance from foreign governments, NGOs, and 
IGOs. While this assistance is often a positive event — granting 
governments access to far more resource than domestically available — 
and while it is almost always eagerly accepted by post-conflict regimes,
 the influx of support can come with unintended pitfalls. The sheer 
number of organizations offering assistance can overwhelm governments. 
After Kosovo’s war, more than 400 organizations flooded into the 
country. In 1995, Rwanda’s post-conflict Ministry of Health had to 
manage 89 NGOs in the health sector alone. The responsibility to oversee
 and coordinate the myriad of organizations most often falls on the 
shoulders of the government bureaucracy. Many states would have 
difficulty effectively managing such a sudden and large increase in 
responsibilities even during peacetime. After having their capacity 
reduced by civil war, these institutions often have little chance of 
successfully managing the relief effort.</p>
<p>Post-conflict governments often face an imbalance of power between 
themselves and providers of international assistance. Crippled by war, 
government institutions lack the de facto authority or capacity to work 
with NGOs and IGOs in the reconstruction process as equals, much less as
 leaders. This is due in no small part to the large share of 
reconstruction funds coming from international donors. Near the end of 
the Mozambique’s civil war, much of the reconstruction funds were 
managed the European Union and UNHCR, and not by the Mozambican 
government. The more the government is dependent on the support of 
international donors for health financing, the more leverage those 
donors and the NGOs they support have in shaping national health 
policies. While NGOs have shown to be better equipped to ramp up 
services quickly than state institutions, a valuable capacity when 
operating in crisis environments, they are self-interested actors whose 
interests are not necessarily parallel to those of the government. 
Ideally, reconstruction funds would be channeled through the Ministry of
 Health, which would disperse them as part of a unified national 
strategy for health system reconstruction; however many post-war 
governments lack the capacity to do so. </p>
<p>When this happens, international donors often select and fund health 
efforts independent of any central coordinating body. The end result is a
 proliferation of disorganized health projects funded by international 
donors and operated by NGOs, each with their own small area of operation
 and with minimal coordination with any national reconstruction 
strategy. This “project-based” reconstruction is particularly likely 
when the regime lacks legitimacy in the eyes of the international 
community. During the early 1990s, Cambodia’s interim government was 
seen as lacking political legitimacy, leading many donors to sidestep 
state institutions and directly fund some seventy NGOs in the health 
sector, “some with little or no official recognition and no obligation 
to locally account for how resources were disbursed, this uncontrolled 
environment was, to take a common phase, a ‘free for all’”. A similar 
problem is seen in Somalia, where decades of ineffective government 
institutions created a uncoordinated project-based effort which placed 
more emphasis on short-term relief than long term health system 
reconstruction. Nowhere is this problem more apparent than in the 
statements of one health professional in Bosnia and Herzegovina who 
described international involvement in his country’s health 
reconstruction process this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>The magic word that opened all doors was “project.” In 
those days, anyone with a modicum of self-respect had to have a project.
 Rushing to submit their project proposals, the experts would sometimes 
forget to change the name of the country in the project title and we 
would suddenly have to decide on a Breast Feeding Campaign in Moldavia 
or AIDS Prevention in Georgia. But, mistakes happen, no harm done. There
 were a lot of other projects, such as Doctors’ Associated against the 
Torture and International Physicians against Nuclear War (although we 
did not have one), and Role of Nurse in the Sequence of the Rape, and of
 course – anti-smoking projects. If somebody wanted to help but had no 
idea what to do, a non-smoking campaign always came in handy. We had at 
least a hundred anti-smoking actions of all sorts. Millions of dollars 
were spent, but to no avail. The locals still smoke. It does not matter 
that at this moment only 30% of the inhabitants of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina have a safe water supply (Simunovic 2007, 5).</p></blockquote>
<p>The inability of weak institutions to manage a unified health 
reconstruction effort has significant detriments to health care 
delivery: health providers become more fragmented and the population 
becomes more dependent on health care directly from NGOs. In post-war 
Uganda this effect was dramatic. The Ugandan health system was 
bifurcated; the government became responsible for secondary and tertiary
 care while internationally funded NGOs provided primary care. This type
 of health care system fragmentation can lead to inefficiencies in the 
health care delivery. Thus, during post-conflict reconstruction, a 
critical component is the government’s capacity to integrate the myriad 
of international assistance efforts into the national health system.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">H</span>ealth worker flight, “brain drain”, 
often occurs during civil war — triggered by threats to personal safety.
 Attacks on the health system often take the form of targeting health 
workers. RENAMO frequently attacked health professionals in the 
Mozambique, both mutilating (Hanlon 1992) and killing them outright 
(Summerfield 1988). In Nicaragua, Contra rebels used a similar strategy,
 attacking and kidnapping doctors, health technicians, nurses, medical 
students, health educators and volunteers — often in rural areas 
(Garfield 1985, Garfield et al. 1987). Similar attacks were seen during 
Nepal’s civil war where health workers were harassed, threatened, and 
assaulted by both the Maoist rebels and government security forces 
(Devkota And van Teijlingen 2009).</p>
<p>Fear for their personnel safety often causes health workers — 
especially those working close active fighting — to abandon their posts 
(Brentlinger 1996). During the Ivorian civil war, many regions 
experienced a pronounced drop in health workers of all types. In 
country’s north, central, and west there was a decrease of 66 percent, 
88 percent, and 88 percent of health workers during the conflict 
respectively (Betsi et al. 2006). This brain drain was most significant 
in doctors. One region saw a 98 percent reduction in the number of 
physicians, who fled to government held areas in the south or to other 
countries (Betsi et al. 2006). During the 1992 war in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, two-thirds of health workers left their posts (Bagaric 
2000). Areas with a Croat majority were particularly hard hit, the 
number of doctors before the war compared to after in Jajce, Fojnica, 
and Travnik dropped from 79 to 4, 37 to 1, and 137 to 18, respectively 
(Bagaric 2000). In Uganda, 50 percent of doctors and 80 percent of 
pharmacists left the country between 1972 and 1985, during a period when
 the country had experienced both an interstate and civil war (Dodge and
 Wiebie 1985). The result of this health worker brain drain is an 
inability to staff health positions to provide adequate care. Worse 
still, the training of a single health worker takes years — even 
decades. Replacing a lost generation of health professionals is a slow 
and difficult process.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n June 1975, after a military coup in 
Lisbon, Mozambique achieved independence and FRELIMO took control of the
 government. The health care system FRELIMO inherited was small and 
dysfunctional. During the colonial period most health workers were 
Portuguese settlers and these Europeans started leaving en mass at 
independence. Within a month, 85 percent of Mozambique’s doctors had 
left the country. Despite FRELIMO’s attempts to stem the flight of 
European health workers with offers of Mozambican citizenship, the 
fledgling state was left with only 30 doctors in the entire country. 
This exodus left many hospitals and other health facilities abandoned or
 crippled by understaffing. The problem was particularly damaging in 
rural areas that were often isolated during the chaotic first few months
 of independence. Health care in these areas was often provided by 
untrained orderlies and by the remnants of FRELIMO’s liberation zone 
health care network.</p>
<p>The new Mozambican government also lacked a pool of skilled and 
semi-skilled workers they could draw upon to manage the health care 
system. There were six economists, two agronomists, and fewer than 1000 
African high school graduates in the country. The lack of capable senior
 and middle level technocrats made it difficult for the government to 
manage the disorganized health system it took over at independence. 
Decision-making was often deferred to a small cadre of administrators 
with little room for outside opinion or flexibility.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, in July 1975 Mozambique nationalized 
health care and launched a major effort to transform the disparate 
collection of private, public, military, and missionary health 
facilities into a single effective health system. The new health system 
was to be guided by the Marxist principles of FRELIMO and the health 
policies started before independence. Health reforms focused on 
expanding health care to rural regions of the country where a majority 
of the population lived through primary and preventative health care 
programs). FRELIMO political leaders believed that the country’s 
political and economic future lay in improving the country’s largest 
industry: agriculture. More specifically, FRELIMO hoped a rapid 
expansion of Mozambique’s health system would improve the productivity 
of rural agricultural workers and thus the entire economy.</p>
<p>FRELIMO’s post-independence health reforms were based around the 
concept of primary health care, a doctrine giving priority to the 
provision of basic health services and preventative care over 
specialized and curative care. Primary health care was seen by FRELIMO 
as the only way the government could improve the health of the vast 
majority of the population that had previously been without any health 
care access. To accomplish this, FRELIMO radically increased health care
 spending: from 4.6 percent of the government’s budget to 9.7 percent 
only a year later. By 1981, government health spending would reach 11.9 
percent.</p>
<p>FRELIMO’s focus on expanding health care was rooted in both political
 strategy and ideology. Even before independence FRELIMO enjoyed 
widespread support amongst the population. This support was a valuable 
resource during the guerilla war against the colonial Portuguese Army 
who “faced fighting in a hostile country against a people overwhelmingly
 antagonistic to them” (Walt and Cliff 1986, 149). Furthermore, during 
the war while FRELIMO did receive some support from abroad, it relied 
heavily on the population for information and supplies. The close 
connection between FRELIMO and the population during the war had a 
profound impact on the development of national health policy after 
independence. Furthermore, FRELIMO’s Marxist roots played a role in the 
high priority given to health. FRELIMO believed western capitalism and 
colonialism were the enemies of the Mozambican people, and that 
improvements in the new state’s health and education systems were the 
key to escaping that poverty (Robinson 2006).</p>
<p>The FRELIMO government’s focus on the well being of the population 
was responsible for a rapid expansion of the health system in the years 
before and at the start of the country’s civil war. Between 1975 and 
1982, over 2000 nurses, 110 x-ray technicians, 290 pharmacists, 272 
midwives, and 1011 village health workers were trained. Similar 
improvements were seen in health facilities. In roughly that same 
period, the government built 593 health posts, 161 health centers, 130 
laboratories, and 80 stomatology  departments. The government also 
instituted a national drug formulary  to reduce the amount the 
government and patients spent on pharmaceutical products. Mozambique’s 
drug formulary was considered to be one of the country’s most important 
reforms and was credited for keeping pharmaceutical spending 
significantly lower than other developing states. The effect on the 
health of Mozambican citizens was significant. By 1980, 30 percent of 
the population had access to health care facilities, up from 7 percent 
in 1974. Furthermore, by the early 1980s Mozambique had the highest 
vaccination rates for children under the age of five years old in any 
African country.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>ith violence in Yemen quickly approaching a full-blown civil war, the New York Times has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/world/middleeast/yemen-mosque-becomes-emergency-room-for-protesters.html?_r=2&amp;src=tp">piece out on the use of one Sana mosque as field hospitals</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In its early days, the field hospital was much less 
organized; doctors would trip over the wounded laid out on the stone 
floor. But the government’s continued reliance on lethal force has given
 the staff practice, and so the doctors and nurses move more easily 
around the small space now, practiced in the chaotic choreography of 
battlefield medicine.</p>
<p>“The most important thing is to be in the field of the injury — 
immediate care saves lives,” said Tarek Noman, a Western-educated doctor
 who conducts triage on the patients, to determine who needs to be 
treated first.</p></blockquote>
<p>Religious institutions have a long history of sheltering medical 
facilities during conflicts. From Bastogne to Tahrir Square, churches 
and mosques have provided ideal locations for setting up field clinics. 
First, the open interiors of most religious buildings, used in more 
peaceful times for believers to gather, offers an excellent area to 
setup medical equipment. Second, the connection between religion and 
sanctuary makes religious building a natural destination for those 
needing help and protection. Third, the prominence (and often sheer 
size) of religious buildings means their location is often common 
knowledge amongst residents. Finally, religious institutions often have a
 strong norm of neutrality and protection from violence. Combatants are 
more likely to think twice about firing on a house of God than on an 
office building.</p>

 in Havana Bay, Cuba. The ship is currently on a three month deployment 
in the Caribbean (Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica), in an 
attempt to boost China’s soft power in the region:</p>
<blockquote><p>China’s presence in Latin America has grown by leaps and 
bounds in recent years and it has become the creditor of last resort for
 cash-strapped Cuba.</p>
<p>Cuba owes several billion dollars to China, and earlier this year the
 two governments signed a series of bilateral accords that will increase
 Chinese participation on Cuban onshore and offshore oil exploration and
 in other areas of Cuban life.</p>
<p>The two governments are negotiating a deal for China to lead a $6 
billion refurbishment of a refinery in Cienfuegos on Cuba’s southern 
coast, with Venezuela providing financial backing for the project.</p></blockquote>
<p>That Peace Ark is in the Caribbean is not surprising. What is 
surprising is the fact that the Chinese military built the ship in the 
first place. A dedicated hospital ship has only two uses: to receive 
mass-casualties from a large amphibious landing (a la Normandy) and 
increase a country’s soft power. Given that an invasion of the latter is
 unlikely in the foreseeable future, something Chinese military 
officials must be aware of, the vessel represents a significant 
investment in soft power. It will be interesting to see if the Chinese 
invest more in this health diplomacy approach, or if this is a one-off 
experiment.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>lately I have been thinking about the 
underreported or overlooked health consequences of war. The effects too 
complicated or dull to deserve a TED Talk or a spot on the evening news.
 One area that keeps coming up in my mind is the budgetary trade-off 
between security and health care provision.</p>
<p>Faced with an armed threat to their sovereignty or the survival of 
their regime, governments often prioritize defense spending over social 
service spending. Governments always face dueling pressures for 
allotting spending between “guns vs. butter”. However, during civil wars
 spending priorities often swing heavily in favor of the military. 
Military spending has been found to rise from (on average) 2.8 percent 
of GDP during peacetime to five percent during civil war. This has 
direct, negative impacts on health system budgets. During the Spanish 
civil war, the republican government created a Ministry of Health and 
Social Care to provide health services to citizens and prevent wartime 
epidemics, however “the military campaign drained public funds and the 
financial resources of the Ministry were tiny” (Baron and Perdiguero-Gil
 2008, 108). A similar focus on the military has been documented in 
Mozambique, where government spending on health decreased from 10.7% to 
4.6% during a five period in the war. Peroff and Podolak-Warren (1979) 
conducted a time-series analysis of appropriation requests by the US 
government between 1929 and 1979. They found some evidence of a 
trade-off in public expenditures relating to conflict, with Vietnam War 
producing the greatest effect during the study period. Apostolakis 
(1992) later conducted a more thorough analysis, using time-series data 
from nineteen Latin American countries between 1953 and 1987. The 
analysis found strong evidence of a trade-off between military spending 
and health. For example, every dollar increase in Argentinian military 
expenditures decreased health spending by 31 cents. Recently there has 
been renewed interesting in this trade-off. In an analysis of government
 spending during both intrastate and interstate wars, Iqbal (2010) found
 that states often favor defense spending over health care spending and 
that the effect is influenced by the severity of the conflict. 
Governments involved in minor conflicts increase the percentage of total
 government expenditures used for military spending by six percent, 
while they decrease the percentage for health spending by two percent. 
This represents a 25 percent decrease in health care expenditures. 
During major conflict the change was only more pronounced, with military
 and health expenditures as a percentage of total government 
expenditures increasing 12 percent and decreasing four percent, 
respectively — representing a 50 percent decrease in health 
expenditures.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>‘ve <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/video-why-soldiers-rape/">talked</a>
 before about rape as a weapon in war, particularly with regards to the 
Democratic Republic Of Congo. Usually discussions of sexual violence 
center around women and children as the victims. Now, a new study by 
Mervy Christian of Johns Hopkins School of nursing <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=93960">says that sexual violence against man by armed combatants is a growing problem</a>.
 The study uses focus groups and interviews of male rape survivors in 
South Kivu. Christian found that the perpetrators of the sexual assaults
 were armed combatants. </p>
<p>The question that keeping coming to my mind is this: what were the 
motivations behind DRC’s sexual violence. One explanation often 
presented is that rapes in the DRC are conducted to force populations to
 flee areas. This is possible, but unsubstantiated through any academic 
research I have been able to find. Another motivation, described in <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/video-why-soldiers-rape/">Lisa Jackson’s remarkable documentary</a> is that raping someone is a key component of the “magic potions” used by some armed groups:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congo Soldier: “The magic potion worked in such a way 
that you’ve got to rape women in order to overcome the enemies who’ve 
invaded our country, the Congo.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This superstition not just held by a few soldiers, the documentary goes on to describe how soldiers were sometimes <em>ordered</em>
 to rape. Since this belief is widely held, then sexual violence could 
be a strategy in two ways. First, whatever the reality, the soldiers <em>believe</em>
 they are acting strategically: raping improves combat effectiveness. 
That might be irrational, but it is no means irrelevant to believers. 
Second, political leaders could be promoting the “magic potion” 
superstition to motivate their fighters to conduct sexual violence which
 furthers the political and military goals. That is, these leaders could
 be strategically attacking populations by tricking their fighters into 
committing sexual crimes they might not otherwise do. Simply put, rape 
could be a weapon and the rapists do not even know it.</p>

<p>Two things to take from this video. First, most of the senior medical
 staff had fled, leaving nurses and medical students. Why? I can’t be 
sure, but it is likely that many of the senior staff had some 
connections to the Gaddafi regime (often the case in one-party 
autocracies) and feared reprisal. This flight has left the hospital 
lacking in a number of major specialties. Second, NTC fighters had and 
continue to violate medical neutrality by entering hospital grounds to 
detain patients suspected of being Gaddafi loyalist. This is not the 
first time I have heard these accusations. This is utterly unacceptable.
 More needs to be done to force the NTC to stop such practices amongst 
it’s fighters.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n a new paper in the Journal of 
Forensic Sciences, Debra Komar of Liverpool John Moores University and 
Sarah Lathrop of the University of New Mexico have <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01931.x/abstract">published [gated] a new survey of the pattern of injuries suffered by residents of Timor Leste during the </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_East_Timorese_crisis">1999 violence</a>.
 During the civil conflict, Indonesian-financed armed groups perpetrated
 widespread violence around the small island nation, killing a reported 
1000-2000. In their paper, the researchers looked at 105 autopsy and 
anthropology reports during that time period. Here are their results:</p>
<blockquote><p>No trauma was found in 25% of the sample, while a further 5% had only minor, nonlethal wounds.</p>
<p>Where trauma was evident, sharp force injuries were most common 
(35%), followed by gunshot (20%) and blunt force (13.33%). (Abstract)</p></blockquote>
<p>The pattern of wounds found in the Timor Leste sample suggest many of
 the wounds were caused by improvised blades and farming equipment, a 
fact that “strongly suggests that the perpetrators were drawn from the 
local citizenry, rather than representing an adequately equipped 
military force”. The authors also note that this distribution of wounds 
looks more similar to Rwanda than it does from similar studies of mass 
violence in Cambodia, Bosnia, Croatia, and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast month, David Poort of Al Jazeera English published a <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/09/201191564045846547.html">story about the secret work of Tripoli’s health workers during the country’s civil war</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Evading the terror in the hospital corridors, a group of 
doctors affiliated with the hospital were said to have set up a network 
of secret field clinics throughout Tripoli, away from the eyes of 
security forces.</p>
<p>Private homes, schools and other buildings were converted into 
makeshift operating theatres, supplied with medical equipment that the 
doctors smuggled out of the hospital’s storage rooms.</p>
<p>It was, according to the doctors, a dangerous undertaking, as 
stealing equipment from the hospital was sanctioned by severe punishment
 if discovered.</p>
<p>“We were undercover doctors,” Noureddine Hassan Aribi, a vascular 
surgeon who was recently appointed as the hospital’s director, recalls 
when asked about the days when it all started.</p>
<p>“It was a nightmare. There were horrible injuries. My colleagues and I
 treated many people in houses in the neighbourhood of this hospital. If
 the wounds were too complicated, we’d take them to a private clinic. We
 removed bullets and stabilised fractures, using primitive tools such a 
planks of wood and pieces of metal.</p>
<p>“We created 24 secret field hospitals all over Tripoli. Some of the 
doctors were caught by Gaddafi’s forces and were taken to prison. At 
least one of them was killed and another one is still missing,” doctor 
Aribi told Al Jazeera.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time clandestine clinics have been established 
during civil conflicts. In the 1990s, Slobodan Milošević revoked the 
autonomy of Kosovo and expanded the power of the Serbian government over
 Kosovo’s institutions, including the police, courts, educational 
institutions, and health system. </p>
<p>The change devastated Kosovo’s health system. Almost two thousand 
ethnic Albanian health workers were dismissed including 263 doctors and 
140 professors of medicine. Many others quit after threats and 
intimidation. By 1991, while ethnic Albanians made up 82% of Kosovo’s 
population, they made up less than five percent of Kosovo’s public 
health workforce. The remaining ethnic Albanian health workers were 
relegated to non-management positions. New rules set down by the 
Belgrade demanded that Serbian be the official language used in Kosovo 
hospitals — a language unfamiliar to many ethnic Albanian health workers
 and patients. Within a few years sixty-four percent of ethnic Albanian 
health workers had voluntarily or involuntarily left their jobs. The 
Milošević government filled the vacancies with health workers brought in
 from other regions of Yugoslavia and from outside the country, many 
lacking the appropriate expertise. The political interference in the 
health system undermined patient confidence. After the dismissal of over
 forty ethnic Albanian doctors, one obstetrics and gynecology department
 dropped from thirty deliveries per days to fewer than two because 
Albanian patients did not trust the Serbian health workers. </p>
<p>In response ethnic Albanians organized a “parallel” health care 
system including private practices in their houses and a network of 
clinics called the Mother Theresa Society. The Mother Theresa Society 
ran 96 clinics around Kosovo and was supported by volunteers and a 
parallel tax system. The ethnic Albanian medical professors and staff 
fired from University of Pristina even founded a parallel medical 
school. Instruction was conducted in Albanian and provided students with
 strong medical knowledge but, due to their lack of access to health 
facilities, weak clinical skills. During the 1990s this underground 
medical school graduated 600 doctors and 1,200 nurses. However, the 
clinic was not safe from violence: during the Kosovo War 90% of Mother 
Theresa clinics were looted or destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>his week the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took a big step into the blogosphere with the launch of <a href="http://intercrossblog.icrc.org/">Intercross</a>. The new blog is written and curated by Simon Schorno, ICRC’s spokesman in DC:</p>
<blockquote><p>Intercross is about the plight of children, women and men
 affected by armed conflict and armed violence. Intercross is about 
humanitarian action. It is about the work the ICRC and international 
humanitarian law and the rich history of the institution I am proud to 
be part of. And it is about interacting with you, our readers, and 
building a place for news and commentary on armed conflict that is 
credible and, hopefully, relevant.</p></blockquote>
<p>The initial set of posts on the blog are great, some new articles and
 some old op-eds. The ICRC has long had a presence on the internet, but 
from the looks of it Intercross is their first <em>true</em> blog: 
personal, informal, and at least somewhat opinionated (which is rather 
rare for the ICRC). I look forward to see how their blog develops and 
wish them luck!</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>ver the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported on revelations of <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904480904576496703389391710.html">gross negligence and criminal mistreatment of patients at Dawood National Military Hospital</a>,
 the Afghan military’s main hospital. American military officers serving
 as mentors in the hospital discovered last year that patients in the 
hospital, where the salaries are subsidized by the US, were being forced
 to pay bribes to receive food and even basic care:</p>
<blockquote><p>A beefed-up group of at least two dozen U.S. military 
mentors had arrived at the hospital in August 2010 as part of the 
“surge” of American forces in Afghanistan. They began to deploy 
throughout the wards, replacing an earlier group that had less direct 
contact with patients.</p>
<p>By the following month, the new mentors began to document what they 
describe as horrific conditions. Maggots fed off patients’ open wounds. 
Nurses and doctors refused to help amputees to the bathroom, and they 
soiled their beds for days.</p>
<p>Several patients died of simple infections because their bandages 
would go unchanged for weeks, while at least four died of complications 
related to malnourishment, according to mentors and internal documents.</p></blockquote>
<p>The US military is reportedly now conducting a full-court push to improve conditions in the hospital. </p>
<p>While clinicians might get the bad press, blame for the tragedy at 
Dawood National Military Hospital must also be directed at the 
hospital’s administrators. Time and again I find that the success of 
post-conflict health reconstruction is determined not by the number of 
beds in a country, but the presence of strong and responsible health 
administrators willing and able to manage and enforce the requisite 
standards of care.  Although not as sexy as training health 
practitioners, the education and training of health administrators is 
often more important.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n an article last week, the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21526919">Economist reported</a>
 that the ferocity of ethnic violence in Karachi, Pakistan, has forced 
the city’s paramedics to adopt an unusual policy in order to safely 
operate in the city:</p>
<blockquote><p>ETHNIC warfare in Pakistan’s most populous city has 
reached such a level that Karachi’s ambulance service now has to send 
out a driver matching the racial make-up of the destination district to 
pick up the victims of gang attacks. Otherwise, the district’s gunmen 
will not let the ambulance through. Now ambulances themselves are coming
 under fire, as gangsters try to stop them saving the lives of their 
enemies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Health workers, particularly paramedics, operating in areas of 
insecurity often have to adapt their standard operating procedures. 
However, this is the first time I have come across “ethnic matching” 
medics to patients in order to insure their safety during sectarian 
strife.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>t has long been suspected that 
Nepalese peacekeepers serving under UN mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) were 
the cause of a devastating cholera epidemic that killed more than 6000 
people and made more than 300,000 fall ill. Immediately after the 
epidemic, the United Nations denied that peacekeepers were to blame, <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-19/us/28219589_1_cholera-outbreak-cholera-strain-minustah">arguing in November that</a>
 “from a medical point of view, there has been no direct connection 
established between cholera and this contingent of soldiers”. However, 
mounting scientific evidence has eroded that claim. In May, a panel 
appointed by the Secretary-General <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/05/un-forces-introduced-cholera-to.html?ref=hp">concluded that</a>
 the Nepalese peacekeepers were the cause of the epidemic. Furthermore, 
last month a study in the CDC’s Infectious Diseases journal <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/17/7/1161.htm">tracked the outbreak back to the MINUSTAH camp in Meille, Haiti</a> where the Nepalese peacekeepers were based.</p>
<p>Now, a <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/08/whole-genome-study-nails-haiti-n.html?ref=hp">new study</a> provides definitive proof of the Nepalese peacekeepers’ involvement in the cholera epidemic. The article, <a href="http://mbio.asm.org/content/2/4/e00157-11">Population Genetics of Vibrio cholerae from Nepal in 2010: Evidence on the Origin of the Haitian Outbreak</a>,
 in the open-access (i.e. not gated) journal mBIO, collected bacterial 
samples from 24 cholera patients around Nepal and compared their genomes
 to those of ten previously studied cholera genomes, including three 
from Haitian patients. Their results: the genomes of the Haitian and 
Nepalese cholera strains are nearly identical. The study provides 
conclusive evidence that the strain of cholera found in Haiti originated
 in Nepal.</p>
<p>It is unclear what practical effects the study will have on the 
ground in Haiti. Given that the Nepalese cholera strain is likely to 
continue to impact the health of Haitians for years — even decades — to 
come, the damage to the reputation of the UN peacekeepers in Haiti has 
already been done. Hopefully this new study will prompt the UN to 
increase anti-cholera efforts in the beleaguered country and to give 
serious thought about how to prevent peacekeepers from being unwitting 
disease vectors in the future.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n paper, the concept of 3D — <a href="http://blogs.state.gov/index.php/entries/defense_diplomacy_development/">integrating US defense, diplomacy, and development efforts</a>
 — promises to elevate the latter two “D’s” into real policy 
alternatives to military force. However, it seems clear now that despite
 the hype, 3D is failing to strengthen the role of development and 
diplomacy in US foreign policy.</p>
<p>In recent months both the US State Department and USAID have faced <a href="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/04/12/appropriators_cut_8_billion_from_state_department_programs">serious</a> <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/us-budget-cuts-could-reverse-usaids-gains/">threats</a> to their budgets, while the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/01/debt-ceiling-deal-defense-budget_n_915128.html">Defense Department</a>
 has been spared. US foreign policy is (and will likely be in the 
foreseeable future) highly military-centric. In this environment, the 
reality of 3D is that it is less about putting diplomacy and development
 in their proper place in foreign policy discussions and more about 
making both of them underfunded auxiliaries of the US military 
(something many in the DoD oppose). If 3D is to be a viable foreign 
policy strategy, the budgets of USAID and State must be expanded, not 
cut.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">S</span>adanand Dhume, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903639404576513734002079242.html">argued today in the Wall Street Journal that drone strikes offer a more humane method of fighting</a> Islamic militants in Pakistan than other methods:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though even a single civilian casualty ought not to be 
taken lightly, the focus on alleged collateral damage distorts the 
essence of the drone program. In reality, technology allows highly 
trained operators to observe targets on the ground for as much as 72 
hours in advance. Software engineers typically model the blast radius 
for a missile or bomb strike. Lawyers weigh in on which laws apply and 
entire categories of potential targets—including mosques, hospitals and 
schools—are almost always off bounds.</p>
<p>All these procedures serve one overriding purpose: to protect 
innocent civilian life. The New America Foundation’s database of strikes
 shows it’s working. This year civilians made up only about 8% of the 
440 (at most) people killed in drone strikes in Pakistan down from about
 30% two years ago. As for affecting U.S. popularity on the ground, 
according to the Pew Global Attitudes survey, the U.S. favorability 
rating—long battered by conspiracy theories and an anti-American 
media—hovers at about 12%, almost exactly where it stood before the 
program’s advent seven years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether you agree or disagree, it is an interesting argument. I am 
interested to see what Conflict Health’s readers think. Do drones make 
for more humane wars?</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2011/07/18/targets-retribution-0">published an excellent report</a>
 on the attack against health workers, health facilities, and patients 
by Bahrain’s government during the country’s recent democratic unrest. 
Here is the punchline:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Since the start of the crisis in Bahrain, Human Rights 
Watch has documented an alarming pattern of attacks, mainly by Bahraini 
troops and security forces, against medical workers, medical 
institutions, and patients suspected of participating in protests, 
primarily on the basis of the injuries they had sustained. At first the 
attacks appeared aimed at preventing medical personnel from treating 
injured protesters, but once the crackdown revived in mid-March security
 forces increasingly targeted medical personnel and institutions 
themselves, accusing some doctors, nurses, and paramedics of criminal 
activity as well as involvement with anti-government protests.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The report goes on to provide detailed accounts of the allegations, 
and it is damning. I encourage you to read the report for yourself. One 
point worth noting: from the accounts it is clear is that the attacks 
were not the result of unclear rules of engagement or overzealous 
security officers, but rather a sanctioned operation by the government 
of Bahrain to treat its own health system as an enemy of the state. This
 type of official “civil war” against one organ of a government is rare 
in middle income, functioning states and speaks to the brutality of the 
crackdown. In the long term, we should expect to see the quality of 
Bahrain’s health workforce decline as health workers avail themselves of
 the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/feb/23/global-health-worker-shortage">global demand for medical professionals</a> and emigrate.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>f there was a universal law of war, I 
suspect it would be that young men with guns and with inadequate 
structure end up looting and killing, whether they are fighting for 
freedom or a dictator. Case in point: late last week Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/07/13/libya-opposition-forces-should-protect-civilians-and-hospitals">reported that health facilities in four towns had been looted by Libyan rebels</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In Rayayinah, one resident who stayed said that rebels 
had looted medical equipment from the polyclinic after taking the town. 
Human Rights Watch visited the facility on July 2 and saw vandalized 
rooms, broken windows and doors, and evidence of missing medical 
equipment, including an x-ray machine and possibly an electrocardiogram 
machine.</p>
<p>The hospital in al-Awaniya, inspected by Human Rights Watch on July 
3, was in a similar condition, with missing equipment, broken windows, 
and damaged furniture.</p>
<p>A medic sympathetic to the rebels told Human Rights Watch that he had
 participated in the looting of the al-Awaniya hospital after rebels 
took the town:</p>
<p>[The al-Awaniya Hospital] was very well-equipped, and we basically 
took everything. It was well equipped for Gaddafi troops. [Rebels] said 
that Zintan would be the central hospital for the region…. I heard that 
the equipment from [the] Rayayinah [polyclinic] went to Zintan too.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch visited the Zawiyat al-Bagul medical clinic on July 3. It had also been attacked and looted by vandals.”</p></blockquote>
<p>By my recollection (and I keep a reasonable close eye on these 
things), these are the first documented cases of looting and/or 
purposely damaging medical equipment by rebel fighters since the civil 
war began. Until now, the Libyan rebels have had a solid record of 
protecting hospitals and behaving kindly towards health workers. It is 
worrying to see that things might be changing.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he United Nations Security Council <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/un-to-expose-those-who-attack-schools-hospitals/">passed
 a resolution last week allowing the UN to publish a list of countries 
or non-state armed groups that attack hospitals or schools</a>. The list will be published in the annex of an annual report on children and armed conflict.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Persistent perpetrators need to face credible 
consequences,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told the 
Council. “If they do not change their behavior, they should face 
measures through sanctions regimes.”</p>
<p>“We do not want to see children being used in conflicts, we do not 
want them to be forced to fight, we do not want them to be injured … or 
killed,” Westerwelle said. Germany holds the rotating presidency of the 
Council this month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Will it work? No, except for a few cases. Governments and armed 
groups who attack hospitals, schools, and civilians tend to be 
unconcerned with international opinion. Why? Because they often receive 
support from natural resources (diamonds etc…), freeing them from the 
need to restrict military tactics in order to maintain public opinion. 
In other words, whether the world likes them or not, they will still be 
able to pay their fighters. Of course, there are a handful of cases to 
the contrary. During the Mozambican civil war, RENAMO rebels lobbied 
hard to win the support of key policymakers in DC. They were somewhat 
successful until a well published massacre made supporting the 
perpetrators impossible. Thus, it is likely that the only time such a UN
 list will be useful is when a rebel group is seeking the support of a 
democratic government, wherein supporting a group on such a list would 
be political suicide for the democracy’s political leaders.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> have a new piece at ForeignPolicy.com
 on the consequences of the CIA’s fake vaccination program on legitimate
 health campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The punchline:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the precarious relationship between health workers,
 militants, and civilians in many areas of both Afghanistan and 
Pakistan, the existence of a fake vaccination program ran by the CIA is 
likely all the evidence many need to accuse all vaccinators and health 
workers of spying. The end result will be fewer families willing to have
 their children vaccinated, and more attacks on health workers providing
 any manner of medical care to communities. Some people will no doubt 
say that the operation was a reasonable and necessary attempt to confirm
 bin Laden’s location, and that nobody was directly put at risk as a 
result. Tell that to the next vaccination team in Abbottabad.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he Guardian reported today that the Central Intelligence Agency <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna">conducted a fake vaccination program in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad</a>
 in a bid to get the DNA of Osama Bin Laden or his children. If the CIA 
could get the blood of Bin Laden’s children during the vaccination 
process, they would be able to compare it to the DNA of his sister who 
died previously — thereby confirming his presence in the city. The 
vaccination program was administrated by local health workers unaware of
 their part in a covert operation:</p>
<blockquote><p>In March health workers administered the vaccine in a 
poor neighborhood on the edge of Abbottabad called Nawa Sher. The 
hepatitis B vaccine is usually given in three doses, the second a month 
after the first. But in April, instead of administering the second dose 
in Nawa Sher, the doctor returned to Abbottabad and moved the nurses on 
to Bilal Town, the suburb where Bin Laden lived.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>If true,</strong> the CIA’s actions are irresponsible and 
utterly reprehensible. The quote above implies that the patients never 
received their second or third doses of the hepatitis B vaccine. And 
even if they did, there is absolutely no guarantee that the vaccines 
were real. The simple fact is that the health of the children of 
Abbottabad has been put at risk through a deceptive medical operations 
by the Central Intelligence Agency. Furthermore, the operation 
undermines future vaccination campaigns and Pakistani health workers by 
fueling conspiracy theories about their true purpose.</p>
<p>Let us be clear about one thing: health care is not a weapon and any use of it as such deserves full-throated condemnation.</p>
<p>Edit: I must point out that the story in the Guardian is sourced to 
the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) and thus could 
well be false. If the ISI told me the sky is blue, I’d ask for a second 
opinion. Independent sources are needed before we know for certain if it
 happened.</p>
<p>Edit 2: It is looking more and more like the story is <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/07/11/117445/pakistan-holds-doctor-who-tried.html">true</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">M</span>aybe, probably. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/refugee-aid-in-tunisia-is-supplying-libyan-rebels/241395/">Last
 week, Marc Herman wrote an article for The Atlantic claiming that the 
Libyan rebels are collecting aid meant for refugees in Tunisia</a> and sending it to rebel warehouses across the border in Libya. Specifically, he claimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the end of that run, Nalut, which is still under 
shelling most nights, has two depots, one for food and one for gasoline.
 Anti-Qaddafi locals at Nalut gather the supplies sent from Tataoine, 
sending them on to 13 other towns under control of the anti-Gaddafi 
militias, according to Mohammed Omar, who runs the warehouse. … Most of 
the tons of rice and pasta had no identification, but large sections 
came from charities, noticeably Islamic Relief. Much of the cooking oil,
 a quantity of pallets about five meters on a side, bore stamps from 
USAID and the World Food Program.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article gives few additional details, making me suspect the 
reporter did not realize the implications of what he had seen until much
 later. However, it certainly wouldn’t surprise me if rebel logisticians
 were purchasing supplies from cash-strapped refugees. If true, it would
 amount to a gross but not uncommon misuse of humanitarian aid by 
non-state armed groups.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">H</span>uman Rights Watch is accusing pro-Gaddafi forces of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/06/29/libya-gaddafi-forces-occupy-hospital-terrify-patients-and-staff?print">occupying a hospital in Libya’s western region for six weeks</a>.
 Units of the loyalist Civil Guard allegedly took control of the grounds
 of Yafran General Hospital from April 19th to June 2nd, preventing 
health workers and patients from leaving. The Civil Guard effectively 
turned the hospital into a combat clinic, forcing the detained health 
workers to treat wounded government forces. According to those detained,
 the occupation was brutal and terrifying, with Civil Guard personnel 
threatening both patients and medical professionals with torture and 
death. The Civil Guard also deployed military weapons on the hospital 
grounds, including anti-aircraft weapons, a clear violation of the 
hospital’s neutrality.</p>
<p>The occupation ended when Rebel forces took the town of Yafran on 
June 2nd. According to Human Rights Watch, despite rebel fighters 
standing guard outside the hospital grounds, no hospital staff has 
experienced any threats or violence from rebel troops.</p>
<p>The occupation of the hospital is just one more egregious violation 
of international humanitarian law by Gaddafi’s forces during the ongoing
 civil war. It is likely the Civil Guard was using the hospital as a 
human shield to protect themselves from NATO air attacks, knowing full 
well that NATO aircraft would avoiding hitting a hospital.</p>
<p>There are two take away points from this report. First, Gaddafi’s forces are fully willing to <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/gaddafi-reportedly-abusing-red-cross-emblem/">disregard the laws of war</a>
 whenever it is tactically advantageous. These violations are only 
likely to increase as his forces are pushed back closer to Tripoli, 
making them more desperate. Therefore, we should expect more cases of 
the exploitation of health workers and hospitals in the future. Second, 
rebel forces appear to be treating the health system with a <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/libyas-health-system-before-and-after-revolution/">significant amount of respect</a>.
 This is a positive sign since as the rebels gain more territory, the 
risk towards health workers and the health system decreases.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span> new research article in the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases claims that<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/17/7/1161.htm"> the 2010 cholera epidemic in Haiti was caused by United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Our epidemiologic study provides several additional 
arguments confirming an importation of cholera in Haiti. There was an 
exact correlation in time and places between the arrival of a Nepalese 
battalion from an area experiencing a cholera outbreak and the 
appearance of the first cases in Meille a few days after. The remoteness
 of Meille in central Haiti and the absence of report of other incomers 
make it unlikely that a cholera strain might have been brought there 
another way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the limited contact people living around the camp had 
with the Nepalese Blue Helmets prevented the epidemic from flaring 
nearby. The team of researchers instead suspect that sewage runoff from 
the MINUSTAH camp contaminated the Artibonite River, infecting those 
drinking the water stream downstream. Massive population movements after
 the earthquake and during the epidemic spread the disease further.</p>
<p>Some Haitian leaders have demanded that the United Nations be held accountable for the epidemic. The <a href="http://defend.ht/news/articles/community/1331-haitian-leaders-demand-un-accountability-for-cholera">Organization for the Solidatiry of Women (SOFA) demanded</a>
 an apology, the returning of $853 million budgeted for MINUSTAH, and 
“all the soldiers of MINUSTAH, break up into groups to work with 
organizations like PAPDA and SOFA, and other organizations of social 
movements, we demand this, because we are not okay, firstly with the 
military occupation”.</p>
<p>The Haitian Ministry of Public Health <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/fighting-the-rise-in-cholera-cases-in-haiti">reports that 344,623 cases of cholera have been recorded since the outbreak began in October</a>, and it has no end in sight.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n April 2nd 1982, the Argentine 
military launched an amphibious landing on the Falkland Islands in the 
South Atlantic Ocean. In response, the United Kingdom flexed the last of
 its imperial might and deployed a task force to retake the islands by 
force. On May 21st, in a small bay, under heavy Argentine air attack, 
the British ships de-gorged themselves onto the beachheads, landing 
thousands of troops. For the next two weeks, Argentine and Britain would
 fight a brutal short campaign, availing themselves of all the benefits 
of modern conventional military technology.</p>
<p>However, even while British and Argentine infantry were engaging in 
some of the most ferocious close quarters battles in the 20th century at
 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Goose_Green">Battle of Goose Green</a>,
 sixty miles to the north British and Argentine military ships stationed
 themselves peacefully within view of each other and regularly 
communicating on good terms. What was this place? <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-50.833333,-58.666667&amp;spn=10,10&amp;t=m&amp;q=-50.833333,-58.666667">The Red Cross Box</a>.</p>
<p>Before launching their attack on the Falklands, the British 
government suggested that both sides establish a neutral point on the 
high seas where hospitals ships from both sides could operate in safety.
 This areas, called the Red Cross Box was approximately twenty nautical 
miles in diameter and within its confines the peace reigned. Stationed 
within the box were four British and three Argentine hospital ships. 
Most of the vessels had only recently been converted to hospital ships, 
with two of the Argentine vessels <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5myGRpteiEQC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=%22red+cross+box%22+falklands&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kRWowQtyJX&amp;sig=eKknogKME2OwcoBMVaoP-w3JWR0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-5YIToj9PKLn0QHb3un8Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22red%20cross%20box%22%20falklands&amp;f=falsemkkk">being hastily converted icebreakers</a>. The ships were <a href="http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/hydra.html">periodically inspected by Red Cross officials</a>
 to make sure they were abiding by the rules set forth in the Geneva 
Convention. Both sides were in regular radio contact to coordinate their
 movements and the movement of patients. The proximity between the two 
sets of medical units allowed for the easy exchange of wounded between 
the ships. One British hospital ship, the S.S. Uganda made four separate
 patient transfers to Argentine vessels. By the end of the war, the 
ships of the Red Cross Box treated hundreds of British and Argentine 
casualties. While a largely overlooked in histories of the conflict, the
 Red Cross Box should serve today as the epitome of the application of 
the Geneva Convention in modern warfare.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">Y</span>esterday CSIS released a new report on
 the little known overseas research labs ran by the US military. I don’t
 have much to say since I will only be able to read the report tonight, 
so until then I present it here without comment. Enjoy.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the spring of 2010, CSIS launched a year-long, 
independent examination of the U.S. Army and Navy overseas medical 
research laboratories. The impetus was an awareness that despite the 
laboratories’ impressive scientific accomplishments and contributions to
 U.S. national interests and global health, they are not well understood
 outside of research circles and consequently find themselves 
undervalued in today’s environment of fiscal austerity. They stand at 
the intersection of health and security, a topic of increased importance
 to U.S. approaches to global health.</p>
<p>The CSIS project aimed to assess the laboratories’ contributions and 
achievements; examine the factors that constrain their performance; and 
propose reforms that will put them on the best course to continued 
success. It included considerable background research, three formal 
meetings of experts, travel to five overseas laboratories, and 
interviews with dozens of laboratory researchers and collaborators. This
 report lays out the project’s research, conclusions, and 
recommendations.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">P</span>reviously on Conflict Health we 
discussed the phenomena of humanitarian relief provided by non-state 
armed groups. While there are a number of historic examples, the most 
well-known (and certainly notable) example is the disaster relief 
operation <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/security-implications-of-pakistan-flood-aid-a-round-up/">launched by Islamic militants</a>
 after the 2010 floods in Pakistan. In the aftermath of the disaster, 
humanitarian organizations affiliated with Islamic militants distributed
 food and other supplies to people affected, often responding faster 
than government agencies. It remains an important example of armed 
groups providing services to the population to increase their own 
political legitimacy and support. Now, there are reports of other 
non-state groups providing humanitarian relief after a natural disaster:
 the gangs of Japan.</p>
<p>Shortly after the earthquake and tsunami hit the island nation 
earlier this year, organized crime groups (called the yakuza) started 
their own humanitarian response. The gangs <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/japan-yakuza-mafia-aid-earthquake-tsunami-rescue-efforts-2011-3">sent dozens of trucks filled with supplies to regions of the country effected by the disaster</a>.
 The trucks carried everything from drinking water to diapers. 
Interestingly, the gangs have reportedly been reluctant to talk about 
their contribution to the response effort, seemingly meaning to keep 
their organizations — currently the target of widespread investigations 
by the police — out of the news.</p>
<p>So why did they do it? Perhaps their disinterest in positive press is
 a ruse and their humanitarian gestures after the earthquake are an 
attempt to improve their image. Or, perhaps they simply felt it was 
their duty to help in the aftermath of the disaster. Either way, the 
humanitarian mission by the yakuza is an interesting example of 
non-state, non-NGO participation in a disaster response.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">C</span>artel fighters in Mexico <a href="http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2011/06/gunmen-kidnap-7-from-chihuahua-drug.html">attacked a drug rehabilitation center in the north of the country on Tuesday</a>.
 Masked gunmen stormed the facility in the town of Cuauhtemoc, 
kidnapping four people. Luckily, nobody was killed — although the fate 
of those taken remains unknown. Drug gunmen have shown little restrain 
when it comes to respecting the neutrality of health care facilities and
 providers in the country. The raid is the latest in a <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/gunmen-attack-mexican-drug-rehab-center">string of attacks</a>
 against rehabilitation facilities in the country. Mexican officials 
believe the attacks are targeting people using drug rehabilitation 
centers to sell drugs on a rival gang’s territory.</p>
<p>The violence has also had a devastating effect on medical tourism. 
Thousand of Americans travel to Mexico each year for low cost medical 
care, and like it or not, these patients are an importance resource of 
revenue for health providers. As the violence escalates, the number of 
patients from the United States (and I suspect elsewhere) <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Special+Report+Monterrey+falls+Mexico+falls/4894463/story.html">is dwindling</a>:</p>

 doctor who helps oversee medical policy at the University of Monterrey,
 which is linked to Christus Muguerza.</p></blockquote>
<p>With little hope of the battle ending anytime soon, we can only hope 
that the health system in Mexico will be spared the brunt of the 
violence.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> am still playing catch-up after the 
move, but unfortunately conflicts do not take vacations. Below are some 
of the most notable stories on armed conflict and public health over the
 last few weeks. Time to get to work.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/gallery/2011/may/27/health-conflict-and-development?CMP=twt_gu#/?picture=374896137&amp;index=2">Health Workers On The Frontline Of Conflict – In Pictures</a><br>
</h3>
<blockquote><p>Health workers like Head Nurse Arlette, from the DRC, 
work in fear every day, putting their own lives at risk for the sake of 
their patients. ‘Our biggest challenge is security, without doubt,’ she 
says. ‘We do not feel safe here.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2011/0315/Guatemalans-sue-US-for-deliberately-spreading-illness-in-1940s-experiment?cmpid=addthis_reddit&amp;sms_ss=reddit&amp;at_xt=4dd42b5ebeb3924d%2C0">Guatemalans sue US for deliberately spreading illness in 1940s experiment</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The court brief charges that US public health doctors 
hired prostitutes diagnosed with syphilis or gonorrhea to have sexual 
relations with soldiers, prison inmates, and psychiatric patients in 
Guatemala with the intention of spreading the disease. Once the 
unknowing subjects were diagnosed with illnesses, the US medical team 
tested them for potential cures, including penicillin. Orphaned 
Guatemalan children as young as 6 years old were used as an uninfected 
test group, according to the suit.

</h3>
<blockquote><p>
The International Committee of the Red Cross says it is forced to cut 
its budget this year, despite mounting crises and increased humanitarian
 needs. The ICRC reports donors are giving less because of economic 
pressures, so it will have to slash more than $90 million from its 
humanitarian activities, bringing the budget down to less than $1.1 
billion.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A temporary move by the Ivory Coast government to make 
health services free in the aftermath of the country’s post-electoral 
unrest has expired, but aid agencies are urging the West African nation 
to extend the waiver and work towards permanently removing healthcare 
user fees.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The hospital is supposed to receive $300,000 from the 
Afghan government this year, but it has not yet been paid, said the 
hospital’s director, Dr. Timono Shah Musamim. The hospital recently 
received a $1.6-million grant from the European Union to renovate the 
buildings, provide medical supplies and staff training.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, Ronen Medzini of Ynet <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4062910,00.html">published an article discussing Israel’s attempts to improve its global imagine through humanitarian diplomacy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So why should a nation that often has a prime spot on the
 UN agenda, largely under negative circumstances, associate itself with 
such an organization? It appears that the slogan that stands at the 
heart of Foreign Ministry efforts to move from separatism to involvement
 is “If you can’t beat them, join them.”</p>
<p>“We have reached the conclusion that the UN is not a body that makes 
only anti-Israeli decisions, but also does many other things,” said 
Eviatar Manor, who heads the Ministry’s International Organizations 
division. “There are issues such as epidemics, desertification and 
climate change, which the government cannot solve alone and there’s a 
need for a global effort.</p>
<p>“We see the UN as an instrument to promote Israeli expertise and 
financial activity. It’s not a crime to use the positive things that we 
do to enhance our ‘soft power,’ and show that we are not just a burden 
on the UN. We provide positive aspects as well.” </p></blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to hear Israel — a state well known for its defiant
 unilateralism — talking about soft power and the power of international
 cooperation. Time will tell if their strategy pays dividends.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">U</span>N Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has published a new report on humanitarian security: <a href="http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/launch-ocha-study-stay-and-deliver">To Stay and Deliver: Good practice for humanitarians in complex security environments.</a>
 The report is a collection of best practices in NGO security in complex
 environments compiled from interviews with 255 humanitarians and a 
survey of 1,100 national staff members. While I recommend reading the 
full report, for your convenience here are the key findings:</p>
<h3>The “How to Stay Mindset”</h3>
<blockquote><p>The objective for humanitarian actors in complex security
 environments, as it is now widely recognised, is not to avoid risk, but
 to manage risk in a way that allows them to remain present and 
effective in their work. This shift from risk aversion (or, on the other
 extreme, recklessness) to risk management represents the culmination of
 the past decade’s evolution in thinking and methodology for programming
 in insecure conditions. Key to this shift is the concept of the 
enabling security approach—an approach that focuses on ‘how to stay’ as 
opposed to ‘when to leave’—which has been adopted in the UN system and 
by many organisations. This mindset in turn depends on organisations and
 individuals accepting a certain amount of risk— the risk that 
inevitably remains after appropriate analysis and all reasonable 
mitigation measures have been carried out.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Avoid Bunkerization</h3>
<blockquote><p>The study recognises that heavier protection is often 
necessary when a clear and present threat of direct targeting exists, 
which cannot be immediately mitigated through greater investment in 
dialogue and acceptance, or in cases where violence is perpetrated by 
economically-motivated criminal groups. In such scenarios good practice 
points to the development of ‘smart’ protection measures, which add a 
layer of security to the organisation but minimise negative appearances.
 In particular, humanitarian organisations need to do more to avoid 
‘bunkerisation’ which distances them from the local community, thereby 
increasing vulnerability and perpetuating a negative cycle.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Increase Security Of National Staff Members</h3>
<blockquote><p>International humanitarian organisations have significant
 room for improvement in tackling the inequities between international 
and national aid workers in terms of providing adequate security 
resources, support, and capacities. The study found that most national 
aid workers believe that overall security management and the balance 
between nationals and internationals was improving, but most also feel 
that they are still more exposed and under a greater burden of risk than
 their international counterparts.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Neutrality Comes From Dialogue, Not Events</h3>
<blockquote><p>A headline finding of this study is that the greater an 
organisation’s demonstrated capacity to communicate and negotiate with 
all relevant actors, the better access and security is achieved for 
humanitarian operations. The ICRC has demonstrated the most active, 
effective, and sustained acceptance and humanitarian negotiation 
strategies. It focuses resources on strategically and continuously 
engaging with all parties to the conflict as well with as local 
communities.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Humanitarians Must Stay Neutral</h3>
<blockquote><p>While simultaneously calling for respect for humanitarian
 principles, in the recent past many humanitarian organisations have 
also willingly compromised a principled approach in their own conduct 
through close alignment with political and military activities and 
actors.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Suleiman Fortiya, who represents Misrata on the 
Benghazi-based opposition National Transitional Council said small 
helicopters flew over Misrata on Thursday and Friday to drop mines in 
the rebels’ major western hold-out.</p>
<p>He said the choppers had been disguised as humanitarian aircraft 
carrying the emblems of the International Committee of the Red Cross and
 Red Crescent.</p>
<p>“They had Red Crescent and Red Cross markers so that anyone who sees them thinks it is for humanitarian aid,” Fortiya said.</p>
<p>An aid worker said he saw helicopters on Friday marked with the Red 
Crescent circling above the port and dropping mines into the sea.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story just broke a few hours ago, not many details yet. If true —
 and there is reason to believe NATO might confirm the story soon — it 
represents another gross violation of international humanitarian law by 
the dictator. This latest move comes just days after pro-Gaddafi forces 
launched an artillery strike against a humanitarian ship offloading food
 and medical supplies on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Could Bahrain’s security forces be arresting medical professionals 
for collecting health data? One opposition leader claims that they are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mattar Ibrahim Mattar, a former member of parliament for 
Wefaq, the country’s leading opposition group, told Al Jazeera that the 
families of medical staff who have been providing treatment to injured 
protesters were being arrested.</p>
<p>“The attack is also against the families of the activists who were 
against the prevention of medical services in the crackdown,” Mattar 
said in a phone interview on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Medical staff were targeted because they had been keeping accurate 
statistics on the number of people injured or killed in the uprising, he
 said, information which the government did not want to be made public.</p>
<p>“It is a way to hide the situation,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>While not confirmed, it is a troubling accusation given the <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/health-system-is-a-battleground-in-bahrains-unrest/">regime’s recent behavior towards its health workers</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">R</span>yan Calder, a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley has been publishing a <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/20/the_improvised_state?page=0,0">series of dispatches from rebel controlled Benghazi</a>.
 Buried at the end of his latest dispatches is a remarkable vignette 
about the changing relationship between the city’s health system and its
 citizens.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before the revolution, some Libyans took their 
frustrations out on Libya’s doctors. “Just a few months ago,” remembers 
El-Fakhery, the anesthesiologist, “people hated Libyan doctors. They’d 
run off to Tunisia or Egypt for something as simple as a common cold.” 
She recalls that a surgeon at her hospital was even physically attacked 
after a failed surgery. “We didn’t have the facilities [to provide 
proper care],” she says.</p>
<p>But with the revolution, people in Benghazi began showing an 
outpouring of support for their doctors. She recalls how on March 19, as
 Qaddafi’s tanks were rolling through Benghazi’s streets and 
Revolutionary Committee members were shooting at civilians, she and 
other doctors were overwhelmed by the number of wounded they had to 
treat — and by the kindness that ordinary citizens were showing them. 
“In the hospital, men as old as my father would run around the ICU 
[intensive care unit] at Jala Hospital [in Benghazi], passing out milk 
and juice and boxes of dates to the doctors,” she says. “They’d stuff 
them in the pockets of my lab coat and shake my hands, and they’d hug 
the male doctors. They’d bring pillows and blankets from home, giving 
everything they could to the hospital.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The more I research and write about health systems during conflict, 
the more I am convinced that they are one of the most important points 
of contact between citizens and their political leaders — both 
democratic and otherwise. The relationship between the population and 
the health system often parallels the relationship betweens citizens and
 the government at large. Health systems are tasked with providing care 
during the most vulnerable times in a citizen’s life (childbirth, 
illness, etc…). How well health systems fulfill that role reveals the 
importance governments place in their citizenry. Governments requiring 
the support of the people build strong and effective health 
institutions, believing that they are a means to gain legitimacy in the 
eyes of population. Governments able to gather resources elsewhere — 
either through external support or natural resources — have little need 
to make such costly investments. In Libyan, the rebels need the support 
of the people, Gaddafi did not.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=5181&amp;cat=voice-from-the-field">Ivory Coast: “Wounded Patients Are Stable, But Their Problems Are Not Over”</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The first to arrive were lightly wounded—those who were 
able to get to the hospital on their own. Then two large trucks arrived,
 carrying many patients. We realized how important our disaster plan 
was, which MSF had developed more than two months previous. Thanks to 
the plan, we were able to triage the slightly wounded and the more 
serious cases.</p>
<p>There were so many patients, we had to stay in the hospital for two 
full days and nights. We operated around the clock, trying to stabilize 
the most serious cases. Despite our intensive care and surgical care 
efforts, two people died.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=92446">Taliban Rue Ambulance Attack</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The use of an ambulance by Taliban suicide attackers in a
 raid on a police training centre in the southern province of Kandahar 
on 7 April has been acknowledged as a violation of war laws and the 
insurgents have promised investigations.</p>
<p>“This will not happen again,” Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told IRIN.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/12/the_war_on_soft_power">The War on Soft Power</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The sad irony is that the Obama administration had been 
moving things in the right direction. When Hillary Clinton became 
secretary of state, she spoke of the importance of a “smart power” 
strategy, combining the United States’ hard and soft-power resources. 
Her Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, and her efforts (along
 with USAID chief Rajiv Shah) to revamp the United States’ aid 
bureaucracy and budget were important steps in that direction. Now, in 
the name of an illusory contribution to deficit reduction (when you’re 
talking about deficits in the trillions, $38 billion in savings is a 
drop in the bucket), those efforts have been set back. Polls 
consistently show a popular misconception that aid is a significant part
 of the U.S. federal budget, when in fact it amounts to less than 1 
percent. Thus, congressional cuts to aid in the name of deficit 
reduction are an easy vote, but a cheap shot. </p></blockquote>

without exploding three days ago have been collected up and stored,

<p>Although nothing suggests that the hospital was deliberately 
targeted, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the 
Somali Red Crescent remind all parties to the conflict of their 
obligation not to harm medical staff, hospitals, clinics and similar 
facilities. Attacks may be directed only against persons taking a direct
 part in hostilities and against military objectives, and warring 
parties must take all necessary precautions to avoid harming the 
civilian population and civilian objects.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">J</span>ust last week I was talking about January’s <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/ambulance-bomb-in-iraq/">ambulance car-bomb in Iraq </a>. Now it appears there has been a <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Afghan+ambulance+bomb+targets+police/4575068/story.html">similar “ambulance bomb” attack in Afghanistan</a>.
 As Taliban fighters attacked a police compound, an ambulance packed 
with explosives was able to fool government security forces and pass 
through at least one security point before detonating. The attack killed
 six and wounded 10. In response, the ICRC released a <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2011/afghanistan-news-2011-04-07.htm">statement condemning the attack</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Using an ambulance for the purpose of deceiving the 
adversary in carrying out an attack constitutes perfidy. This is 
strictly prohibited by international humanitarian law and is totally 
unacceptable,” said Jacques de Maio, the ICRC’s head of operations for 
South Asia.</p>
<p>By violating the neutrality of health care services, such acts of 
deception endanger medical personnel engaged in caring for the injured 
and sick in hospitals, clinics and rural health posts. “They undermine 
the delivery of and access to health care, already precarious for 
ordinary Afghans in many parts of the country as a result of the 
conflict,” added Mr de Maio.</p></blockquote>
<p>Medical neutrality is critical in conflict. It is also difficult to 
achieve and easy to lose. It is a tragic that at least one group of 
Taliban is violating it to gain a tactical advantage.</p>

 has been overlooked in much of the media. However, for readers of 
Conflict Health the events in Bahrain should be of particular interest. 
Why? Because much of the political unrest <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/04/20114512347348853.html">is occurring</a> in the nation’s health facilities.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/article.cfm?id=5171&amp;cat=special-report&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DoctorsWithoutBordersNews+%28Doctors+Without+Borders%2FM%C3%A9decins+Sans+Fronti%C3%A8res+News+Updates%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">new report</a>,
 Medecins Sans Frontieres claims that Bahrain’s government has attacked 
and “militarized” the health system, making protesters and bystanders 
afraid of seeking treatment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following a military operation against protestors on 17 
February, many sought refuge in the Salmaniya Hospital grounds. 
Salmaniya was seen as a safe place for the opposition protestors to go. 
During this time, as the protests continued, wounded demonstrators were 
received in Salmaniya as well. When ambulances were blocked from 
reaching patients, the doctors at the hospital began leading protests 
themselves.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons, health professionals making speeches and 
leading protests directly from the steps of the entrance to the hospital
 undermined the concept of a neutral hospital, as did the 
anti-government slogans painted onto the walls of the hospital.</p>
<p>Instead of asserting the neutrality of the medical structures, the 
government declared Salmaniya Hospital a legitimate military target, 
calling it a “stronghold of the opposition protestors.” This completely 
and wrongfully undermined the notion that all patients have a right to 
treatment and all medical staff have a fundamental duty to administer 
treatment. This military reaction was exponentially more damaging to the
 trust in the health system than the activities of the opposition 
protestors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, MSF claims that the military has been arresting patients
 they find with the distinctive wounds from “bird-shot”, the type of 
shotgun ammunition used by the government against protestors. 
Reportedly, the military is searching the wards for these types of 
wounds, using them to identity and detain individuals who were at the 
protests.</p>
<p>Interestingly, MSF argues that as a signatory to the Geneva 
Convention, Bahrain must “must allow health facilities in Bahrain to 
resume their core activity of treating patients in an impartial way.” 
However, I am not sure the Geneva Convention applies in this case. The 
Geneva Convention does apply to armed conflicts that occur inside a 
state, but does not apply to lesser forms of conflict (e.g. a murder, a 
protest, etc…). However, it is debatable whether Bahrain’s political 
unrest constitutes an “armed conflict”. If it does, then the health 
system of Bahrain is legally a neutral third-party with special 
protective rights, if not, then the actions of Bahrain’s military (while
 utterly reprehensible) are entirely governed by the country’s domestic 
laws — which I imagine are highly favorable to the military. The tragic 
events in Bahrain demonstrate the need for stronger de facto and de jure
 protections for health systems during “less-than-war” conflicts — 
particularly in non-democracies.</p>
<p>Here are some other stories from Al Jazeera on the military’s crackdown on the health system in Bahrain:</p>

<blockquote><p>The answer is surprisingly complicated. The science of 
counting deaths in war is a subset of epidemiology, the science behind 
the cause and spread of disease. The ideal method, according to Paul 
Bolton, a professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns 
Hopkins, is to conduct surveys by going door-to-door and tabulating the 
number of deaths in each household.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>But, in the early phases of a war, such methods are almost impossible
 to carry out. “When the bullets are still flying,” says Bolton, “the 
only method available is to count bodies.” This, of course, poses its 
own challenges. Researchers must devise creative mechanisms to collect 
information from locals—gleaning information from cemeteries or places 
that sell shrouds, for example.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">B</span>uried near the end of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/30/libya-government-use-landmines-confirmed">this article by Human Rights Watch</a> is one of the most interesting piece of news I have seen about Libya in the past week. It comes in a single paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rebel forces in Benghazi, now in control of the stockpile
 of antivehicle mines in the city’s arms depot, told Human Rights Watch 
that they will not use any type of mines. The pledge was made by Gen. 
Khalifa Hufter, commander of the rebel forces in Eastern Libya, during a
 meeting in Benghazi on March 25.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an opponent of land mines, I take this news as a hopeful sign. 
However, as a political scientist I cannot help but ask myself why the 
rebels would make such a pledge. During the first few days of the Libyan
 civil war, it seemed that the rebels could reach Tripoli within the 
week. However, now the military situation has largely equalized with 
both rebel and government victories. Given that there is the real 
possibility that Gaddafi’s forces could march on Benghazi in the future,
 it seems strange for the rebels to avoid using an effective (and 
inhuman) weapon. Of course, we cannot overlook the real possibility that
 the general’s comments were cheap talk and he would deploy landmines if
 the situation became dire. Regardless, I hope for his sake and the sake
 of the civilians in Libya that he finds no reason to make such a 
decision.</p>

 used by the Libyan rebels. Two things come across in the article. 
First, the health system is largely ad-hoc, relying on a loose 
collection of medical students, doctors, and paramedics. Second, the 
health professionals have little experience with war trauma. Let’s hope 
the international community can help with the latter.</p>
<blockquote><p>A tiny clinic built mainly for foreign workers at this 
oil facility has turned into a front-line field hospital for the rebel 
army. Volunteer doctors from across Libya’s east have replaced the long 
evacuated foreign staff and toil to patch together fighters blown up by 
the rockets and tank shells of Moammar Gadhafi’s army.</p>
<p>“We’ve followed the revolution,” said medical student Ahmed 
Abdel-Jalil, gesturing at his colleagues sitting in an ambulance outside
 the hospital earlier Tuesday.</p>
<p>As the eastern-based uprising against Gadhafi has gathered pace and 
moved west, doctors and nurses have moved with it, taking over small 
local hospitals and dealing with a flood of gunshot and shrapnel wounds 
unfamiliar to most medical workers.</p>
<p>“This is the first time for most doctors to face war injuries and

<h3><a href="http://www.jasonnickerson.ca/blog/?p=80">Anesthesia in Libya</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Access to safe emergency and essential surgery is 
fundamental for delivering comprehensive health services in Libya. It is
 essential not only for treating the injured, but for ensuring safe 
access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care and treatment of 
emergency surgical needs extraneous to the conflict (among others).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The battle in Libya has reached the doors of Dr. Aiman’s 
clinic in Misrata: A man was killed in its entrance late Wednesday, he 
said, probably by fire from the tanks that have surrounded the hospital,
 though it could have been snipers loyal to Col. Moammar Gadhafi.  </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A short walk from the morgue, men gathered at noon 
Wednesday before a billboard that read “Free Libya” and listed the dead 
and wounded in the fighting that had raged for days a couple of hours 
away along the Mediterranean. No. 15 was Mahmoud Abdel-Hamid, from 
Benghazi. No. 43 was Ibrahim el-Sharif, from Ajdabiya. </p></blockquote>

<p>The hospital began receiving hundreds of sick and injured. By 
mid-day, more than 70 patients of various nationalities (Bangladeshis, 
Egyptians, Tunisians) have received medical care for various conditions.
 This numbers went up to hundreds of people as the day unfolded. 
Moroccan nationals from Libya also benefited from the care provided by 
the medical facility. Between 15 and 20 Moroccans a day flock to the

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span> few days ago I received an email from
 James Knochel at SendTheEnterprise.org. I had never heard of the group 
before. Their goal is to save the USS Enterprise from the scrapyard by <a href="http://www.sendtheenterprise.org/">converting it into a dedicated disaster response ship</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Navy is planning to send the Enterprise on two 
6-month cruises before throwing it away. They’ll have to cut it up to 
extract the nuclear reactors, so there’s no prospect for turning it into
 a museum. The Enterprise’s replacement, the USS Gerald R. Ford, is 
specifically designed to reduce operating costs. The Enterprise is just 
too expensive for the Navy to keep as an active warship.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing away a perfectly functional ship, we propose that the Enterprise be dedicated to disaster response.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a horrible idea. Enterprise is too big, too deep, too costly,
 and too old to be a viable dedicated humanitarian and disaster relief 
ship. The fundamental problem with Knochel’s idea is that it seems 
primarily interesting in finding a mission for the ship, rather than 
finding the right ship for the mission. In other words, it is about 
saving Enterprise, not saving people. If you are really interested in 
providing effective humanitarian relief, loading disaster response 
modules onto many ships would be a better choice.</p>
<p>However, given that it is clearly an original idea, I thought I would
 throw it out there to readers and see what your thoughts are.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span>merican military units, <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/japan-earthquake/u-s-navy-steps-up-earthquake-relief-efforts-in-japan-1.137604">including a small fleet of ships</a>,
 continue to arrive on station in Japan and conduct disaster relief 
missions as requested by the Japanese government. The disaster relief 
operation is being called <a href="http://www.dvidshub.net/news/66953/iii-mef-continues-relief-efforts-support-operation-tomodachi">Operation Tomodachi</a>, or Operation Friendship. But one japanese speaker points out that the name is more nuanced than simply “friendship”. <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/DevEconHealth/status/47115199651659776">According to one aid worker</a>:
 Tomodachi is usually only used to refer to very close friends with 
mutual obligations. It is a perfect name for U.S. response in Japan.</p>
<p>Japan is a highly developed state, second only to the United States 
in gross domestic product. Unlike Haiti, it has significant emergency 
services which have been <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2011/03/11/japans-sophisticated-tsunami-warning-prevented-losses/">responding brilliantly to the disaster</a>. So, when the USS Ronald Reagan set sail for Japan, it was unknown whether they would even be needed.</p>
<p>Time has shown that the US support has been helpful in Japan, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/us-delivers-coolant-to-quake-hit-japans-n-plant/articleshow/7685383.cms">supplying coolant for nuclear reactions</a>
 and delivery humanitarian supplies. But even if they were not needed, 
there is a greater point to the disaster relief mission: a show of our 
support.</p>
<p>Japan might have never needed our help. They might have been able to 
handle the disaster response entirely on their own. But the deployment 
of US military personnel sends a single, critical missive to the island 
nation: 日本の皆様、世界が応援している, roughly translated: People of Japan, we have 
your backs.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n Monday on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/03/how-food-could-determine-libyas-future/72097/">TheAtlantic.com I argued that the United States should assist rebel groups in Libya by sending food aid</a>.
 This option would allow the U.S. to provide much needed supplies to the
 rebels while avoiding direct military involvement in the conflict. 
Interestingly, yesterday The Washington Post reported that Europe and 
the United Sates were <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/08/AR2011030805868.html?hpid=topnews">considering some very similar to my proposal</a>. Now my ego would like to believe I played some role that (rumored) plan, but we all know governments do not move that fast.</p>
<p>If true — and at this point that is a big <em>if</em> — the next 
question is how can the US and other states deliver the aid. Luckily, 
the provisional capitol of the rebel of Benghazi has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Benghazi">decent port facilities</a>. Last week <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110226/wl_uk_afp/libyapoliticsunrestevacuate">HMS Cumberland</a> and a <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE7282IK20110309">World Food Program ship</a> both used the port, although the latter aborted a previous attempt due to reports of airstrikes in the area.</p>
<p>The question I pose to readers is this: If the US Navy was called 
upon to delivery food and other aid to rebel controlled areas of Libya, 
what would be the best way to go about it?</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>or more than a decade Medecins San 
Frontieres (MSF) — an organization for which I have a particular soft 
spot — has been conducting immunization campaigns in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo’s North Kivu region. As with other MSF missions in 
conflict zones, the organization negotiated security guarantees from the
 belligerents. This guarantee is critical for the humanitarian 
organization to operate in unstable regions and provides some level of 
protection for staff and patients. However, on October 17th, 2009 the 
MSF vaccination program in North Kivu was exploited: it was the bait in 
an ambush.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=4055&amp;cat=press-release">an MSF press release from two years ago</a>,
 the health services provided by its teams were used by Congolese army 
units to target rebels and civilians gathered at the vaccination sites:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We feel we were used as bait,” said Luis Encinas, head 
of MSF programs in Central Africa. “The attacks coincided with the 
beginning of our vaccination and put the lives of civilians in extreme 
risk. Thousands of people, and the MSF teams, were trapped in the 
gunfire. The attack was an unacceptable abuse of humanitarian action to 
fulfil military objectives. How will MSF be perceived by the population 
now? Will our patients still feel safe enough to access medical care? We
 are compelled to strongly denounce this situation as such actions 
seriously compromise our neutrality.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I have not talked to MSF about this incident and the press release 
contains few details, but if true it is a disheartening case of 
humanitarians being used as unwitting pawns in combat operations.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>his week I have a new article on The Atlantic <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/03/how-food-could-determine-libyas-future/72097/">proposing a different type of U.S. intervention in Libya: food aid</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It still appears unlikely that Qaddafi will step down on 
his own accord. If the rebels are to free Libya, it will probably mean 
taking Tripoli by force and toppling Qaddafi outright. Currently, rebels
 in eastern Libya are mustering an army — mostly raw recruits and seized
 weapons — which they may use to do just that. But Benghazi is just over
 1,000 km, about 630 miles, from Tripoli. Defeating Gadaffi would 
require this irregular force to travel hundreds of miles across the 
Mediterranean coast, all the while supplying itself through what would 
likely be a series of battles along the Gulf of Sidra, Sirte, and then 
in Tripoli itself.</p>
<p>Warfare has changed much since Napoleon’s Grande Armée marched across
 Europe, but one of the Little Corporal’s maxims is just as true in 
Libya today as it was near Waterloo two centuries ago: armies march on 
their stomachs. The anti-Qaddafi rebels are no different. The push to 
Tripoli would require consistent access to — amongst other things — food
 supplies. While having adequate food alone would not be sufficient to 
take the capitol (they also need war materials, training, and 
transportation), it is an absolute necessity. And, right now, the rebels
 don’t have enough. But we do.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was originally conceiving the piece, the debate on what — if 
any — US intervention should take place was squarely fixed on three 
options: arming the rebels, enforcing a no-fly zone, and conducting air 
strikes. While definitions of the term vary, I think it would be fair to
 consider all of these options as “hard power” approaches to the crisis.
 The purpose of my article was to inject a soft power option into the 
discussion: with a win-win outcome, lower financial cost, less risk to 
American lives, and less chance of being drawn into full involvement. 
Given the detrimental effects food shortages have had on military 
operations in the past (notable for General Lee’s army in the US civil 
war and Napoleon’s Grand Army in Europe) there is a solid precedent for 
the benefits food aid can have on an rebel’s fighting capacity, both 
directly through feeding the fledgling army and indirectly though 
assisting the civilian population they govern.</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>rom 1998 to 2000, Ethiopia and its 
former territory Eritrea fought a devastating border conflict. This was 
not some minor dispute, but rather a total war between two modern 
states. Both countries invested hundreds of millions of dollars — an 
incredible portion of their national budgets — towards the conflict. The
 battles were brutal, hard, and mechanized — often fought <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/756845.stm">between entrenched armies with armor and artillery support</a>. Much of the war would have not felt out of place in the 1916 Somme.</p>
<p>Late last year, three researchers published a <a href="http://www.hicn.org/papers/wp89.pdf">working paper at the Household in Conflict Network (HiCN) [PDF]</a>
 on the effect of the war on the short and long-term health of children 
in both countries. Using household surveys, the researchers examined the
 height differences of children in each countries before and after the 
war. Previous research has established that the lack of health (e.g. 
disease and malnutrition) is reflected in childhood growth rates, 
measurable by their height divergences from the average.</p>
<p>The study found two results of interest. First, the researchers argue
 that displacement and deportation were likely the greatest causes of 
health insecurity during the conflict. Fighting caused widespread 
displacement amongst both Eritrean and Ethiopian civilian populations. 
Furthermore, thousands of families were forcefully deported back to 
their countries. This would be particularly damaging to rural farmers 
unable to harvest their crops or prepare for the next season. </p>
<p>Second, the impact of the war was different for children in Eritrea 
than in Ethiopia. Children born before or during the war in Ethiopia had
 a smaller difference in height than children born before or during the 
war in Eritrea. Given that the war was eventually won by Ethiopia, this 
result lends credence to the theory that there are meaningful 
differences in health depending on the military outcome of the conflict.</p>

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-1-100_files/erws.jpg" alt="Erws" class="frame" border="0" height="314" width="600"></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week on UN Dispatch I discussed a new journal article in this month’s <a href="http://www.undispatch.com/in-nepal-explosive-remnants-of-war-continue-to-maim-and-kill"><em>Injury Prevention</em> on explosive remnants of war (ERWs) in Nepal</a>.
 The study surveyed 307 civilian victims of ERWs five years after the 
civil war ended. It offers an interesting snapshot of the long-term 
consequences of explosive devices on the battlefield. Here are takeaway 
points:</p>
<blockquote><p>75.8% of injuries were caused by homemade explosive 
devices. A majority of the injuries came from improvised explosive 
devices, most notably homemade grenades. This is rather unusual. In 
other conflict zones, landmines or unexploded ordinances were the 
primary causes of ERW casualties. The likely explanation is that these 
poorly made explosive devices failed to detonate during battles, 
becoming de facto landmines. The two deadliest types of homemade bombs 
were sutali bombs and socket bombs (also called pipe bombs). These 
weapons accounted for 30.9% and 28% of all ERW injuries reported in the 
study.</p>
<p>55% of victims were under the age of 18. Following patterns found in 
other former warzones, children are disproportionately at risk from 
injury by ERWs. The reason is likely that children are unaware of 
dangers from handling ERWs. Indeed 50% of injuries reported in the study
 were sustained “when victims were handling or otherwise tampering with 
(throwing, hitting, or burning) explosive devices” (Bilukha et al. 2011,
 3).</p>
<p>38% of injuries occurred in the victim’s home. The researchers 
suggest one reason for the high number of injuries at home is because 
some people were “unafraid to handle explosives” and “willing to bring 
them to or store them in their homes” (Bilukha et al. 2011, 5). This is a
 clear sign that more ERW education is necessary.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems clear from the statistics that the best intervention against
 these types of injuries is education. This is especially true for 
children, who are often injured or killed while tampering with ERWs they
 find near their homes.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he <a href="http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/warfare.cfm">Colonial Williamsburg Journal has a great overview article on germ warfare during colonial times</a>.
 While Europeans in the colonies had little understanding of the 
disease, they knew enough about its practical effects and methods of 
infection to use it as a crude, if effective, weapon:</p>
<blockquote><p>During Pontiac’s uprising in 1763, the Indians besieged 
Fort Pitt. They burned nearby houses, forcing the inhabitants to take 
refuge in the well-protected fort. The British officer in charge, 
Captain Simeon Ecuyer, reported to Colonel Henry Bouquet in Philadelphia
 that he feared the crowded conditions would result in disease. Smallpox
 had already broken out. On June 24, 1763, William Trent, a local 
trader, recorded in his journal that two Indian chiefs had visited the 
fort, urging the British to abandon the fight, but the British refused. 
Instead, when the Indians were ready to leave, Trent wrote: “Out of our 
regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of 
the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week Jenna Krajeski published a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/02/the-clinic-in-the-mosque.html#ixzz1D7AnOJPy">short piece in The New Yorker on the health clinic setup by protesters in Tahrir Square</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday, around midnight, I went to Abdel Rahman with 
three of my Al-Masry Al-Youm colleagues. Badges made from tape 
identified a group of men at the door as security; like so many roles in
 the city abandoned by the police force, volunteers were keeping the 
clinic safe. The scene inside was active but calm. The front area had 
been converted into a treatment room, with patients on the floor or 
sitting on chairs, having their blood pressure taken or being handed 
medicine from the impressive stock that lined a back corner. Barriers 
made from hanging prayer mats partitioned the women’s section from the 
men’s; inside, a few women slept in their clothes. The back area was 
full of sleeping men—protesters too sick or exhausted to persevere in 
the square, where it had begun to drizzle lightly—immobile lumps under 
thick, synthetic blankets.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few days after her article was published, there were reports 
(although I cannot find a link to them anymore) of three similar 
makeshift hospitals in the area. It is a brilliant example of the 
self-organization of health services in crises.</p>
<p>Update: Here is an earlier related article about <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/8290609/Egypt-protests-Hospitals-and-morgues-collect-the-fallen.html">hospitals during the protests</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">S</span>o far I have been quiet on events in 
Egypt, mainly because the health effects have been (thankfully) 
relatively minor. However, with pro-democracy protests in Egypt 
continuing for their third week, the strain on the nation’s health 
system are beginning to mount. Last week at UN Dispatch, I <a href="http://www.undispatch.com/what-is-happening-to-egypts-health-system">attempted to summarize some of the health effects of the protests</a>, particularly regarding real and potential strains on the nation’s health system. The takeaway point: </p>
<blockquote><p>Away from the protests the situation is similarly dire. 
With little to no police presence in many areas, the health system is 
vulnerable to ransacking and looting. Residents of one Cairo 
neighborhood organized a posse to protect a local pediatric cancer 
hospital from a group of armed men. Violence and checkpoints on the 
street also appears to be deter some health workers from working out of 
fear of their personal security. While much of the press coverage is 
focused on the health of the protesters, it is the stories from other 
areas that should give us pause. They show an Egyptian health system 
which is at best stretched to its limits, and at worst teetering on the 
brink. There is a real risk that all Egyptian citizens will face long 
term reductions in health access, even those individuals uninvolved in 
the protests.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">M</span>y first post on UN Dispatch is now live. It is <a href="http://www.undispatch.com/the-health-consequences-of-an-intervention-in-cote-divoire">a short discussion of the possible health consequences</a> of an AU intervention in Côte d’Ivoire: </p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo controls 
the vast majority of the country while the internationally recognized 
winner, Alassane Ouattara, remains holed up in an Abidjan hotel 
protected by United Nations troops. While calls for western involvement 
have cooled in recent days, there is still the real possibility of an 
African intervention as the African Union summit sets to start this 
weekend. With the debate about an African Union intervention in Côte 
d’Ivoire coming to a head, it is worth considering the health 
implications of such a use of force, specifically the risk of infectious
 disease.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be clear, I am not saying an AU intervention in Côte d’Ivoire is 
necessarily a bad idea. However, I do believe that debates over the 
application of military force, even by international bodies, must take 
into the account the potential health impacts for the local population. 
When doing the cost-benefit analysis for international intervention, we 
would do well to look beyond the strictly political ramifications.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">S</span>omehow during his tenure as SOUTHCOM 
commander, current EUCOM commander and Supreme Allied Commander Europe 
Admiral James G. Stavridis, found time to pen a 292 page book on the 
United States’ relationship with Central America (except Mexico), South 
America, and the Caribbean. The book was just published by NDU press and
 is <a href="http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis.html">available for free on their website</a>.</p>
<p>Stavridis’ book, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Partnership For The Americas</span>,
 is not your typical command memoir; rather it reads more like a 
manifesto on the potential of soft power in US-South relations. His main
 takeaway point: “We are all in this together”.</p>
<p>The book covers a range of topics, from counter-narcotics operations 
to innovation in the Department of Defense, but of particular interest 
to me is the Admiral’s chapter on health engagement. Specifically, the 
role he argues medical diplomacy can play in a combatant command:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It may seem at first incongruous for a combatant 
command, even one which strives to be as interagency-oriented and 
forward-leaning as U.S. Southern Command, to be engaged in efforts to 
improve public health. And perhaps it is, particularly if that is how 
our engagement efforts are expressed or viewed. If, however, we 
restructure our strategic approach and message to convey that we 
subscribe to the understanding that “public health” plays a vitally 
important role in maintaining long-term stability, then we can restate 
our strategic objectives more along the lines of removing and/or 
reducing health issues as a potential factor to increased likelihood of 
conflict. Thus, our continuing commitment to engaging in what some have 
termed “medical diplomacy” becomes inherently synchronized with our 
previously stated strategic goals to promote security, enhance 
stability, and allow for economic prosperity.” (Stavridis 2010, 140)</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not something you would expect to read from a man occupying the same office as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Ridgway">Ridgway</a>.
 However, Stavridis is absolutely correct. While the core competency of 
the American military will always be combat operations, there are a 
growing number areas where United States interests and goodwill can best
 be secured through soft power, including health diplomacy. In an ideal 
world these tasks would be the responsibility of USAID and the 
Department of State, but, to adapt a phrase from former Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld: you advance US interests with the agencies 
you have, not the agencies you want. And if you can do so with hospital 
ships instead of gunboats, all the better.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>wo months ago, Washington Post Staff Writer David Brown wrote a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/militarymedical/?sid=ST2010110104926">series of articles on modern military medicine</a>,
 mostly in Afghanistan. I know I am playing a little bit of catch up by 
highlighting the articles now, but they are good pieces and I think 
Conflict Readers will find them useful. The articles are listed below:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/25/AR2010122502142.html">A military hospital’s all-encompassing mission</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>American soldiers critically injured on the battlefield 
spend only a day or two here, many unconscious and on ventilators, 
before being sent to Bagram air base, then to a hospital in Germany and 
on to the United States.<br>
ad_icon</p>
<p>At the other end of the continuum are the Afghans who make up about half the patients.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/30/AR2010123004610.html?hpid=artslot">Medical research is part of the military’s combat mission, too</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>There are 96 military “research activities” underway or being planned in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Before any begin, an eight-person Joint Combat Casualty Research Team
 addresses two key questions: Does this study have to be done here? Is 
it feasible? If the answers are yes, the team helps researchers 
fine-tune their study design and sometimes helps collect data. A “human 
protections administrator” audits the activities, which are first 
approved by ethics panels in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/30/AR2010123004768.html">War zone trauma cases yield medical insights</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Military medicine has made consistency and self-scrutiny 
part of the mission. It takes to heart the quality-assurance mantra “If 
you can’t measure it, you can’t change it.” It values publication in 
peer-reviewed journals as much as does the faculty of Harvard Medical 
School.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/29/AR2010102906782.html?nav=emailpage">Teleconferencing from the war zone improves treatment for wounded soldiers</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The conference helps ensure no injuries are overlooked in
 patients who often have a dozen wounds or more. It’s a way of 
double-checking innumerable pieces of information that have been entered
 into a database and will be studied to help improve practice. It’s also
 a way of gently monitoring everyone’s performance.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he first book I ever read on the 
health effects of war was a neglected library copy of Dr. Pierre 
Perrin’s Handbook on War and Public Health. The book, originally written
 in french, is a guide for planning and conducting health operations in 
conflict environments. While it contains very little theory, it is 
packed with practical information and insight. For a week I poured over 
the book again and again, trying to take in everything I could. Many of 
the topics I am still researching today were originally inspired by 
concepts in Perrin’s book.</p>
<p>I always wanted a copy of the book for myself, however the only 
copies I could find cost over $500 (the current price on Amazon is 
$965). So you can understand my excitment when last week I discovered 
that the Health Library For Disasters has <a href="http://helid.digicollection.org/en/d/Jh0215e/">published the full text of Perrin’s book online</a>, for free.</p>

 US military’s health diplomacy capacity and an occasional blogger. She 
also just returned from a deployment in the US Army Reserve. Eventually,
 I am going to persuade Gail to pen a few guest posts for Conflict 
Health, but until then I invite you to <a href="http://mendstate.blogspot.com/">read her blog</a> and welcome her back to the good ol’ US of A. To get you started, here are two of her latest posts:</p>
<h3><a href="http://mendstate.blogspot.com/2010/12/biological-warfare-1491-by-charles-c.html">Biological Warfare: “1491″ by Charles C. Mann</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>As Charles’ army fled a counter attack, mercenaries split
 off from the main retreating body, spreading syphilis as they went via 
their habit of rape and pillage. Within a year, European cities were 
banishing people who suffered from syphilis. It’s not clear whether the 
disease came from American with Columbus’ returning voyage, as 
suggested, with an equal number of arguments for and against. Hence any 
positive assertion of biological symmetry is sketchy at best. Mann makes

<h3><a href="http://mendstate.blogspot.com/2010/12/history-of-foreign-aid.html">The history of foreign aid: “Samaritan Diplomacy”? </a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Also relevant, the theory of counter insurgency calls for
 massive development expenditures in dangerous areas in order to create 
sympathies for the legitimate government, in order to assist people 
attain their basic life needs–water food shelter–so they feel better 
about their government and ‘buy in’ to it’s legitimacy, lay down arms 
and stop harboring terrorists. But, as pointed out in the Washington 
Post front page yesterday, it’s not that easy. USAID and the US State 
Department in Afghanistan, for example, only want the military to 
provide “security” so they can provide development assistance. Yet their
 vision of security and the military version are disparate. And 
sometimes discussions about where to deliver development assistance veer
 toward the absurd when geographical areas are deemed “too safe” for 
development assistance and other areas not safe enough. USAID doesn’t 
want to deliver aid where it’s unsafe, and they don’t want to waste 
their aid on places where it’s too safe. And they damn sure don’t want 
the military to meddle in their humanitarian space (as they call the 
battlefield) by delivering aid or creating development projects.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ate last year, CSIS released a <a href="http://csis.org/publication/health-reconstruction-north-korea">short paper by Stephen J. Morrison</a>
 on the impact of Korean unification on North Korea’s health systems. It
 is a brief but solid analysis and I encourage everyone to read it.</p>
<p>In the article, Morrison makes a number of points, but one in particular resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Health reform is a powerful ‘soft power’ tool to win 
‘hearts and minds,’ bring quick tangible gains, and consciously help 
legitimize a new order. … Attention in the first instance should be paid
 to the most vulnerable victims of the current failed system. In the 
North Korean context, that means targeted attention to children; 
pregnant and lactating mothers; the elderly; orphans; and populations 
newly pauperized, in urban settings as well as marginalized regions such
 as the northeast.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Morrison argues, and I agree with him, that the quick reconstruction 
of North Korea’s dilapidated health care system could play a critical 
role in stabilizing the political process of reunification. When Korean 
reunification occurs, whether through the unlikely event of peaceful 
political transition or the violence collapse of the North Korean 
regime, it will be imperative for the South and her allies to help 
reestablish a governing institution seen as legitimate in the eyes of 
North Korean citizens. This is no easy task, political legitimacy is 
hard to develop in the best of circumstances and even more difficult in 
situations of extreme political stressors such as regime transition or 
collapse. We only need to look to Afghanistan to see the difficulties of
 building legitimate national governing institutions.</p>
<p>The benefit of focusing on health as a means of building political 
legitimacy in post-unification North Korea is twofold. First, improving 
health care is one of the few short-term actions available to South 
Korea that is relatively immune to misinterpretation. Second, due to the
 massive disparities between North Korea’s and South Korea’s health 
systems, a health access benefit can be provided to North Korean 
citizens relatively cheaply. Extending the South’s health system a few 
hundred miles to the North would be difficult, but certainly less so 
than rebuilding a national health institution from scratch. Furthermore,
 the South Korean health system would face fewer of the cultural and 
linguistic barriers usually seen during international health 
reconstruction efforts. Compared to other methods of gaining political 
legitimacy, rebuilding the health care system of the North is, for lack 
of a better phrase, low hanging fruit.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">R</span>ead enough about health care in 
Afghanistan and one statistics keeps popping up: 85% of Afghans have 
access to health care, up from 9 percent in 2002. It is a figure 
regularly cited <a href="http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/Program.33a.aspx">government reports</a> and <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-11/04/content_7010784.htm">mainstream newspapers</a>. And, it is <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2010/1208/An-inflated-claim-of-health-success-in-Afghanistan-exposed">false</a>.</p>
<p><del datetime="2011-01-04T14:13:03+00:00">As is often the case with 
quantitative claims, the devil is in the definitions. In this case, a 
person is defined as having access to health care if they live in a 
province district with one or more basic health facilities. Thus, the 
entire population in any province district with a single hospital, or 
perhaps even a clinic, is considered to have health access. The problem 
is that many provinces are vast, spanning thousands of square miles of 
rugged, mountainous terrain. One of Afghanistan’s largest provinces, 
Kandahar province, covers 20,858 square miles. This makes Kandahar 
province slightly larger than Costa Rica. It would be laughable to claim
 a single hospital in San José would provide adequate health access to 
all of Costa Rica, but that is the claim we are making in Afghanistan.</del></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Smart Conflict Health reader Francis Regan 
has pointed out that the definition uses “districts” not “provinces”. 
So, I have to eat my words a bit, since there are 34 provinces and 
around 398 districts. So, the the claim is still disingenuous, but not 
nearly as much as I originally thought.</p>

<p>Epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux concluded that the cholera originated

<p>Sadly, this link between contagion and conflict is a common theme for
 many neglected tropical diseases. They are the most important diseases

require the US to ask China and its military for assistance:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even under the best conditions, a mass evacuation is no 
easy task. In July 2006, as a battle brewed between Israel and 
Lebanon-based Hezbollah militants, the U.S. took nearly a month to 
evacuate 15,000 Americans. According to the Government Accountability 
Office, “nearly every aspect of State’s preparations for evacuation was 
overwhelmed”, by the challenge of running an evacuation under low-threat
 conditions in a balmy Mediterranean summer.</p>
<p>Evacuating a Korean war-zone would be far harder. And the U.S. would likely have no choice but to ask China for help.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast month, Obama administration, in a little discussed announcement, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/us-cut-pakistan-military-aid">connected the provision of military aid to the human rights record of the recipient</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The US government plans to cut military aid to several 
Pakistani military units as punishment for human rights abuses, 
including torture and extrajudicial executions, according to senior 
officials.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The sanctions centre on the deaths of hundreds of people at the hands
 of Pakistan’s regular and paramilitary forces in the Swat valley since 
an operation to drive out the Taliban started in May 2009.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The units to be sanctioned have not been identified, but they are 
understood to include elements within 12 Punjab infantry regiment, which
 is based in north-western Mardan, and units from the Frontier Corps, 
the paramilitary force recruited from the Pashtun tribes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I am not sure how the US is able to cut aid to specific 
units of the Pakistani Defense establishment or, if they are, how the US
 can guarantee that the sanctions are not subverted by some enterprising
 Pakistani officers. But, the broader question is this: What takes 
priority in US foreign policy: short-term national security interests or
 long-term human rights interests?</p>
<p>One needs not look far in history to see that traditionally the 
former has held sway while the latter is given mostly lip service. It is
 for this reason that I am interested in the implications of this new 
policy. This action by the Obama administration could well be part of a 
larger realization that the health and human rights of foreign 
populations do matter in modern international affairs. In a world of 
super-empowered individuals, you can’t just win hearts and minds, you 
have to make sure your allies are winning them too.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The anonymous Gulliver, who writes at <a href="http://www.tachesdhuile.blogspot.com/">Ink Spots</a>, and who knows more about military assistance than myself makes this smart comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Military assistance,” in this case, is NOT fungible. 
We’re talking about specific pieces of equipment and training, not just 
cash grant aid. So the USG monitors the end-user of the assistance and 
ensures that defense articles and services aren’t being provided to 
human rights violators. This is not a “new policy” — it’s actually a 
requirement of the law (via Leahy), and as such is not something that’s 
left to the discretion of the administration. Leahy is an ever-present 
in deliberations about military assistance to Central and South American
 forces, and has also complicated the growing U.S. security relationship
 with Indonesia.</p></blockquote>

<p>The venerable <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/">Human Security Report Project (HSRP)</a>
 at Simon Fraser University is one of the leading centers of research 
on, amongst other things, the health effects of armed conflict. This 
morning, HSRP released their flagship product: the Human Security 
Report. You can <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/20092010/text.aspx">download the full report (by section) on their site</a>, or read the Cliff Notes summary points below:</p>
<blockquote><p>“- Four of the world’s five deadliest conflicts––in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and<br>
Somalia––involve Islamist insurgents.</p>
<p>- Over a quarter of the conflicts that started between 2004 and 2008 have been associated with Islamist political violence.</p>
<p>- In the post-Cold War period a greater percentage of the world’s 
countries have been involved in wars than at any time since the end of 
World War II.</p>
<p>- Armed conflict numbers increased by 25 percent from 2003 to 2008 after declining for more than ten years.</p>
<p>- Intercommunal and other conflicts that do not involve a government increased by more than 100 percent from 2007 to 2008.</p>
<p>- The impact of the global economic crisis on developing countries 
risks generating political instability and increasing the risk of war.</p>
<p>- Wars have become “intractable”––i.e., more difficult to bring an end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Of particular interest to Conflict Health readers is the report’s 
detailed discussion of the reliability of Battle-Death data in <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/docs/Publications/HSR20092010/20092010HumanSecurityReport-Part3-TrendsInHumanInsecurity.pdf">Part 3 [PDF]</a> of the report. The punchline: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Given the range of different ways of collecting data, 
why do conflict researchers seeking to understand the causes, duration, 
and deadliness of conflicts rely increasingly on the battle-death data 
produced by organizations like PRIO and UCDP? The short answer is that 
notwithstanding their utility for the purposes for which they were 
intended, none of the other estimation methods can be used to provide 
annual global and regional battle-death trend data in a timely manner.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This should be a clarion call to public health and conflict 
researchers both inside and outside academia on the need for better data
 on the health impacts of armed conflict, a point driven home in the <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/counting-iraq%E2%80%99s-dead/">huge variation the estimated civilian casualties during the Iraq War</a>.
 Battle-death data is one of the most commonly used variables in large-N
 studies of armed conflict. Without reliable measurements of the health 
cost of armed conflict, amongst other things, we lack the means to 
accurately target health interventions both during and after war.</p>

<p><em>Today Conflict Health presents something different. This week <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/30/wikileaks-cables-bradley-manning">Wikileaks released a quarter million US diplomatic cables onto the internet</a>.
 Many outside the military and diplomatic communities have wondered just
 how such a large amount of sensitive missives could have been taken. As
 a public service, Conflict Health is very pleased to publish a guest 
article from Captain Nick Dubaz, an Active Duty Army Civil Affairs 
Officer, explaining in full technical detail how it happened.</em></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span> number of commenters on the latest 
Wikileaks release have questioned how one junior enlisted Army 
intelligence analyst could possibly have collected and stolen such a 
massive number of documents unaided and undiscovered. Indeed, the very 
mention of “intelligence” evokes notions of secure, guarded, windowless 
facilities under constant surveillance employing the latest biometric 
technology to secure America’s secrets. This image may have once been 
partially true in the case of Top Secret and Compartmented information, 
but the distributed nature of our modern intelligence community and the 
proliferation of secret network access necessitated by our wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan has fundamentally changed both protection of and access 
to classified information. The technical methods Private First Class 
Bradley Manning, the accused leaker, may have used to obtain and steal 
the material and transmit it to Wikileaks are simple and demonstrate the
 intelligence community’s vulnerability to an insider threat.</p>
<p>All mission traffic in Iraq and Afghanistan occurs on computer 
systems classified at the Secret-Releasable to NATO/ISAF level or above.
 Historically, mission traffic occurred at the Secret-NOFORN (Not 
Releasable to Foreign Nationals) level on the SIPR network (Secret 
Internet Protocol Router) and non-US elements operated on separate 
networks known as CENTRIX segregated by organizational membership (NATO,
 ISAF, etc). This caused significant information sharing problems and 
now lower level U.S. forces are transitioning many functions to CENTRIX 
to create a common mission network. Regardless, these information 
systems are now present at every Company-level headquarters and above, 
providing wide access to Secret-level intelligence and diplomatic 
information processed and disseminated on the network. Access to Top 
Secret (TS) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) information 
systems remains much more limited, but is still partially vulnerable to 
Bradley Manning-like insider threats. </p>
<p>The Wikileaks reports on Iraq and Afghanistan are from a system known
 as CIDNE (Combined Information/Data Network Exchange) which is the 
latest iteration of the database of record for all tactical reporting 
across the OIF and OEF theaters. The release is only a tiny percentage 
of the actual data contained in the database. Each record in the 
Wikileaks release is only the initial text report often transcribed from
 the radio or secret chat rooms. After the incident/action is completed,
 each record is typically updated with new information, pictures, 
videos, PowerPoints and other relevant documentation. To allow for 
transfer into incompatible systems and other software packages, CIDNE 
includes an “Export to Excel” feature that allows for the rapid 
filtering and transfer of records to other systems. Bradley Manning 
likely utilized this feature to export the comprehensive CIDNE database 
that he would later transmit to Wikileaks. Such an action could be 
completed in less than an hour depending on the bandwidth available and 
leaves no signature that would be readily noticed as unusual or 
alarming.</p>
<p>State Department “Cables” reside on a different system on State’s 
SIPRnet website, but are no more protected or less vulnerable to 
aggregation and theft by an insider threat. In addition to the website, 
Cables are also disseminated through the Defense Messaging System’s 
(DMS) SIPRnet website known as M3 (Multimedia Messaging System) which 
rapidly transmits intelligence reports, cables and other messages to 
designated recipients and is searchable by other users. Both systems 
provide the capability to export massive numbers of records rapidly and 
it is likely that the leaker utilized these systems to collect the 
records now plastered on newspapers and websites worldwide.</p>
<p>Once downloaded on a computer system, removing the files is no more 
difficult than their export. As an Analyst in the Headquarters of the 
4th Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Stewart, but deployed to 
Iraq, Bradley Manning likely worked in a Secure Compartmented 
Information Facility (SCIF) accredited to process Top Secret, Sensitive 
Compartmented Information. In the United States and its permanent 
facilities worldwide, SCIFs are built to exacting standards of secure 
construction outlined in the Unclassified DCID 6/4 accredidation and 
TEMPEST electronic emissions security standards. SCIFs often have 
several layers of security and are regularly inspected to ensure 
compliance with strict security regulations. In the austere conditions 
of Iraq and Afghanistan, such facilities are constructed and operated 
under less-stringent “Tactical-SCIF” regulations. Locations with only 
SIPR have significantly fewer restrictions and indeed it is not rare to 
see a mud hut on remote mountaintop outposts in Afghanistan with SIPR 
network access.   </p>
<p>Whether in a modern SCIF in Fort Stewart or a remote mud hut with 
SIPR access, the responsibility for security for information and 
physical security resides with the owning unit. The vast majority of 
units and individuals in these units take security very seriously and 
self-inspect and police to ensure compliance with regulations for fear 
of severe consequences should an inspection discover lapses or 
violations. Nevertheless, it is not unusual to see rules bent or broken 
and iPods or music CDs brought into a SCIF particularly in austere, 
deployed locations where oversight is lax. Indeed, in a post-thumb drive
 access Army, Bradley Manning burning a CD in his workplace in Iraq 
would have garnered little attention from co-workers and his alleged 
marking of the disk as “Lady Gaga Music” did little to facilitate the 
theft of the data. Furthermore, I have seen no distinguishing 
origination information in the records and had Bradley Manning not 
exposed himself as the leaker to Adrian Lamo, we may have never 
discovered the original source of the leaks.</p>
<p>In perhaps less than one hour from start to Lady Gaga-labeled CD 
filled with Secret records, our post-9/11 information sharing programs 
and basic information systems technology enabled the greatest theft and 
public release of current intelligence and diplomatic cables in United 
States history. Both our information systems security and 
counter-intelligence programs are largely focused on outsider threats to
 classified information, largely ignoring insiders outside of periodic 
security clearance reviews and rare polygraphs. The insider threat to 
classified information cannot be solved through re-compartmenting access
 to intelligence information and adding further challenge to the already
 difficult work of intelligence analysis. These leaks should give us 
pause to evaluate our failed security clearance system and internal 
electronic audit and security procedures, but must not precipitate a 
return to pre-9/11 stovepipes that served our nation so poorly.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">E</span>arlier this month, the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/world/africa/11uganda.html?_r=2&amp;src=me">reported on Washington’s fears about weak security at Africa’s infectious disease laboratories</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, and a 
delegation of Pentagon officials visited the laboratories on Wednesday 
for the first stop on a three-country tour of East Africa to assess the 
next generation of American security concerns.</p>
<p>The team also visited the Uganda Virus Research Institute, where the 
Ebola and Marburg viruses are taken to study and kept in a spare room in
 a regular refrigerator near the bottom of the compound. Warning signs 
say “restricted access,” but the doctors there say that hardly means the
 area is secure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fears about Ugandan labs have become particularly penitent since Al-Shabab’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/world/africa/13uganda.html"> recent activity in the country</a>.
 Without greater security, there is the real risk of disease specimens 
falling into the hands of non-state groups. Of course, this threat is 
contingent on these groups having the technical capacity to transport 
and weaponize the specimens, something easier said than done. Probably 
our best defense against this type of bioterrorism has nothing to do 
with ourselves and everything to do with the terrorist organizations. 
There are cheaper and more dependable methods of attacking US interests.
 Most Islamist groups have decades of experience with conventional 
explosives and might see little valuable in investing in a complicated 
and untried method of attack. From the perspective of an Islamist 
bomb-maker with finite resources, it is better to build 100 inkjet bombs
 than steal and weaponize an Ebola specimen from a Ugandan lab.</p>
<p>This does mean we can ignore the threat? No. We should take serious 
pause from the fact that the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo sent a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no4/olson.htm">medical team to Zaire in an attempt to research and weaponize Ebola</a>.
 However, the technical difficulty of weaponizing infectious diseases 
combined with easy access to more conventional weapons does moderate the
 threat from insecure African laboratories.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n late October and early November, Thailand’s southern provinces were <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/204452/flood-hits-southern-provinces">hit by major flooding</a>. The flooding, triggered by a tropical depression, <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/204452/flood-hits-southern-provinces">affected around 100,000 people by one account, with waters up to three meter high.</a></p>
<p>In response, the Thai government sent the Royal Thai Navy vessel that
 is an oddball of world navies. While most coastal nations maintain 
naval forces, only handful operate aircraft carriers (Brazil, France, 
India, Italy, Russia, Spain, Thailand, UK, US). The vessel, HTMS Chakri 
Naruebet, is the flagship of the Royal Thai Navy and is the smallest 
aircraft carrier in operation. Since being built by Spain in the 
mid-90s, the carrier has been most famous for rarely leaving port (one 
source claims the ship only has funding to leave port one day a month). 
However, it does deploy sometimes. Since coming into service the ship 
has taken part in four disaster relief missions. This makes disaster 
relief a (if not the most) common mission for the ship.</p>
<p>However, you’d be wrong to compare the HTMS Chakri Naruebet’s 
disaster relief mission with those of the United States Navy. Based on 
an article in the Pattaya Daily News, the aircraft carrier contribution 
to the <a href="http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2010/11/03/thai-aircraft-carrier-assists-southern-relief-efforts/">relief
 effort was limited to single truck load of supplies (mostly bottled 
water, according to the photos in the article) and a few helicopter 
flights over the disaster area</a>. Far from being the nations knight in
 grey armor, the carrier’s mission seems to be mostly disaster relief 
theater on the part of the Thai leadership. This is not the first time 
Thai military has been used to provide token disaster relief, in 
mid-october Thai Royal Highness Princess Soamsavali ordered <a href="http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2010/10/19/thai-princess-orders-sattahip-aav%E2%80%99s-into-flood-stricken-regions/">two Amphibious Assault Vehicles to assist flood victims in Thai’s northeast region</a>. Two! You’d probably be better off hiring some local fishing boats.</p>

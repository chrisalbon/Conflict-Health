 The report is worth checking out, as Feldbaum is, for my money, the 
leading thinker on the topic. Here is an excerpt from the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Numerous reports have outlined the goals the Obama 
administration should pursue in global health. This brief does not seek 
to add to those or to propose detailed policy solutions to the cases 
discussed. Instead it seeks to demonstrate that U.S. global health 
policy has global political ramifications that cannot be ignored and 
that demand permanent capabilities within the U.S. government. It 
describes the need for improved U.S. diplomatic capacity on global 
health, outlines the currently fractured architecture of the U.S. 
government on this issue, and issues recommendations for building 
diplomatic capacity for global health.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly food for thought.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/5544/the-new-rules-keeping-disasters-in-perspective">The New Rules: Keeping Disasters in Perspective</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Between Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano and the oil 
slick in the Gulf, everybody seems to have disasters on the brain 
lately. Some of it stems from the nonstop global media coverage, while a
 good portion relates to our growing awareness of climate change. But a 
lot of this heightened anxiety is simply misplaced. We don’t live in an 
increasingly dangerous world, whether you’re talking wars, terrorism, 
disasters — or just the weather. In fact, we live in the safest times 
yet known to humanity. We just choose not to see it that way for a 
variety of reasons.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://militarytimes.com/blogs/scoopdeck/2010/05/04/the-hospital-ship-of-the-future/">The hospital ship of the future</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Although Navy, Military Sealift Command and civilian 
officials have raved about the hospital ships Comfort and Mercy, they’re
 25 years old and can be difficult to manage — their size (70,000 tons) 
and deep draft (about 30 feet) means they often must anchor in deep 
water and accept patients by air or boat. So we took the chance Tuesday 
to ask Navy Surgeon General Vice Adm. Adam Robinson and Rear Adm. Mark 
“Buz” Buzby, head of Military Sealift Command, what they would 
incorporate into a new generation of hospital ships, if they could start
 with a clean sheet of paper.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/05/eight-us-troops-will-remain-in-haiti-down-from-20000/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+WiredDangerRoom+%28Blog+-+Danger+Room%29">Eight U.S. Troops Will Remain in Haiti, Down From 20,000+</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>And it looked like they might be there to stay. “Haiti, 
for all intents and purposes, became the 51st state at 4:53 p.m. Tuesday
 in the wake of its deadly earthquake,” noted Time magazine. “The U.S. 
military effort alone will soon have 33,000 troops ashore or in direct 
support of the relief operations,” predicted the Weekly Standard. Gen. 
David Petraeus, the head of U.S. Central Command, said he was watching 
to see if there might be an impact on operations in Central Asia and the
 Middle East.</p>
<p>That didn’t happen. In a bloggers roundtable this week, Army Maj. 
Gen. Simeon Trombitas, the head of Joint Task Force Haiti, said that 
only 850 servicemembers were left on the ground in Haiti. And the 
military task force there, he added, will dissolve at the end of this 
month.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://wikis.uit.tufts.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=34807224">Winning Hearts and Minds? Examining the Relationship Between Aid and Security in Kenya</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>This case study on Kenya, researched and written by Mark 
Bradbury and Michael Kleinman, is the first in a series of publications 
presenting the findings of a two-year FIC comparative study on the 
relationship between aid and security in northeastern Kenya and in five 
provinces of Afghanistan. The overall study has focused in particular on
 trying to determine the effectiveness of aid in promoting stabilization
 and security objectives, including by helping to “win hearts and minds”
 of local populations. (For more information and links to publications 
related to the study see the Aid and Security project page.)</p></blockquote>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">C</span>SIS Global Health Policy Center has published a <a href="http://csis.org/publication/conflict-pandemics">new report on the role of the Department of Defense in three global health areas</a>:
 (1) global pandemic preparedness, (2) military-to-military health 
cooperation, and (3) protecting and rebuilding civilian health systems 
in conflict environments. While the report contains solid points 
throughout, I was most impressed with its argument regarding civilian 
health systems. In the report, Eugene Bonventre, James B. Peake, and 
Elizabeth Morehouse argue that the DoD’s approach to civilian health 
systems in conflict has so far been ad hoc, despite the fact that 
effective health systems are often a core component of 
legitimacy-building in counterinsurgency operations:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Preserving civilian health system capacity during 
conflict is not only an obligation of the military, but it actually 
helps the military achieve its own strategic objectives. The better the 
civilian health sector functions during a conflict, the fewer injured 
and sick civilians will require treatment in military field hospitals 
that are ill-equipped to address many of the needs of the women, 
children, and elderly who represent the demographic groups most affected
 by conflict. During a counterinsurgency, where a host nation’s 
legitimacy is tied to the population’s perception of its government as a
 reliable and equitable service provider, preserving civilian health 
capacity is also strategically important. The more effectively the 
government provides essential services (including public health 
services) to its population, the sooner a counterinsurgency can be won.”
 (Bonventre and Peake 2010, 24)</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors propose a “A New Paradigm Of Preserving Civilian Health 
System Capacity” wherein war planners do more than simply not bomb 
health facilities: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Current DOD policy mandates that its soldiers and 
contractors adhere to International Humanitarian Law (IHL) in all 
conflicts, regardless of the conflict’s context or character. IHL, which
 includes not only the four Geneva Conventions, but also treaties and 
customary law, requires that militaries minimize the impact of war on 
civilian public health and medical care. This responsibility is more 
complex than merely including hospitals on “do not target” lists. 
Minimizing the impact of conflict on civilian health requires optimizing
 efforts to preserve the integrity and capacity of the affected nation’s
 health system as a whole.” (Bonventre and Peake 2010, 23)</p></blockquote>
<p>To develop this paradigm, the report offers five suggestions for the DOD regarding civilian health systems in conflict:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Recommendation 1: The DOD should develop a civilian 
health theme for conflict and postconflict planning in close 
consultation with other relevant U.S. government and other agencies.” 
(Bonventre and Peake 2010, 26)</p>
<p>“Recommendation 2: DOD should support a civilian-led comprehensive 
strategy for assisting a conflict-affected nation to reconstruct 
essential health services.</p>
<p>“Recommendation 3: DOD should be prepared to play a major role in 
support of the reconstruction of the military health services of 
conflict-affected nations in close coordination with civilian health 
sector reconstruction.” (Bonventre and Peake 2010, 27)</p>
<p>“Recommendation 4: DOD should support a transition strategy that 
parallels and facilitates the transition from relief to development.” 
(Bonventre and Peake 2010, 27)</p>
<p>“Recommendation 5: All agencies including DOD should measure the 
impacts and outcomes that their conflict-related civilian health 
assistance programs have on health and on security and stability.” 
(Bonventre and Peake 2010, 28)</p></blockquote>
<p>Recommendations 1 and 2 are dead on. For too long DoD war planners 
have considered civilian health systems the sole responsibility of the 
humanitarian space. Often, US military’s engagement of these systems is 
only slightly more than “don’t bomb hospitals”. However, foreign health 
systems are central to US interests. Health systems are fundamental 
bureaucracies of the state. They provide the most observable indicator 
of a government’s priority towards its citizens and its capacity to act 
on it. In all non-failed states, the political legitimacy of the 
government is inherently linked with the citizens’ perception of service
 delievery by the state. Weakened health systems reduce government 
legitimacy and open the door to illegal political challengers. Quite 
simply, health systems are central to national stability and security.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n May 5th, Somali fighters of Hizbul Islam <a href="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/5531/war-is-boring-somali-islamists-escalate-war-with-clinic-attack">attacked the Dr. Hawa Abdi camp outside Mogadishu</a>.
 The camp had been a refuge for up to 6,000 Somali families during the 
country’s long war-torn history. Named after the gynecologist who 
founded the camp, it offered a variety of services, including a clinic 
operated by Médicins Sans Frontières.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the gunbattle erupted after a <a href="http://www.warisboring.com/?p=5216&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+WarIsBoring+%28War+Is+Boring%29">guard hired by Médicins Sans Frontières owned money to a local resident, who contacted Hizbul Islam</a>.
 The Islamist fighters came to arrest the guard, who refused to pay. 
Despite the death of the Hizbul Islam commander in the firefight, the 
Islamists eventually overran the camp’s guards. They then detained 20 
local staff members and shut down the health clinic.</p>
<p>On May 9th, the fighters withdrew from the camp but continued to hold
 the staff members hostage. Furthermore, the clinic was devastated by 
the fighting:</p>
<blockquote><p>They left behind ruined infrastructure, barren storerooms
 and an atmosphere of terror. “The hospital cannot function at the 
moment due to severe damage from the attack,” Deqo said. “All medical 
personnel are not working because of the bad condition the hospital is 
in. Over the last two days, eight children died in the feeding center 
because the nurses could not work and feed them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The point? Attacks against humanitarians are not always strategic. 
Sometimes the presence of undertrained guards and money is enough.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>ith US forces in Afghanistan scattered
 across large and small bases, the military has faced a logistical 
nightmare. In turn, this has driven the Army and Marines to look for new
 solutions to the age old problem of military logistics. <a href="http://defensetech.org/2010/05/05/marines-bullish-on-unmanned-helicopters-for-aerial-resupply-of-far-flung-ground-units/">Two of the more promising solutions comes from rotary wing UAVs: specifically the A160T Hummingbird and the K-MAX</a>.
 Both pilotless aircraft have carried 1,250lb sling loads over 172.5 
miles in test flights and the latter has been flown continuously for 18 
hours. The military hopes to use these UAVs to cheaply and safely ferry 
supplies to US forces during operations. But, do UAVs also have a role 
to play in humanitarian and disaster relief operations?</p>
<p>Experience in Haiti has shown that logistics is an area of 
humanitarian-military cooperation with major promise. The power of the 
US military to transport cargo from A to B is unparalleled. Rotary wing 
UAVs could improve that capacity through high speed, low cost aerial 
resupply to humanitarians on the ground. A hospital needs a generator? 
Organizing a ground convoy could involve 20 to 50 people. One A160T 
Hummingbird could complete the same mission in less time with only a 
small crew of remote pilots (who do not even need to be in the disaster 
zone). Using UAVs for humanitarian purposes is a growing idea, in South 
Africa UAVs are being tested as <a href="http://www.nhls.ac.za/about_news.html">airborne medical couriers in rural regions, carrying specimens to testing facilities</a>.</p>
<p>It is something to think about.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, the <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/usns-mercy-deploys-on-pacific-partnership/">US Navy deployed USNS Mercy</a> on a humanitarian deployment in the Pacific. The news prompted <a href="http://www.warisboring.com/?p=5149">Kyle Mizokami of War Is Boring to rue Japan’s lack of soft-power humanitarian cruises of its own</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s a question: why doesn’t Japan have its own version
 of the Pacific Partnership? Why doesn’t Japan have two former 
supertankers, converted to 1,000 bed hospital ships, and sail them from 
Africa to the South Pacific, delivering non-emergency humanitarian 
assistance? With its aversion to hard power and immense reservoirs of 
talent, technology, and cash, Japan should be the absolute king of soft 
power. Despite that, it displays an utter lack of imagination and a 
hesitation to copy even highly effective ideas. Yet again it prefers to 
just lend a hand to the Americans than do anything on its own.</p></blockquote>
<p>Japan’s lack of hospital ships has nothing to do with a limited 
imagination or a hesitation to import good ideas from overseas. In fact,
 many would argue that historically Japan’s power came precisely from 
its willingness to adopt good ideas from other societies. No, the reason
 for no Japanese hospital ships rests squarely in Article 9 on the 
Japanese constitution.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Article 9 requires that “land, sea, and air 
forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained” by the
 island nation. In other words, it is illegal for Japan to have a 
military. The nation’s Self-Defense Force is a civilian organization, 
with its members even allowed to quit at any time. Article 9 is a 
security guarantee to Japan’s neighbors. Without a standing military, 
the thinking goes, Japan can never threaten other countries with war.</p>
<p>What do hospital ships have to do with military aggression? Nearly 
everything. Hospital ships are an old concept and until a decade ago 
they had only one purpose: to provide medical supports to military 
forces on campaign. Floating hospitals are a requirement for amphibious 
operations. This is precisely the reason USS Kearsarge and USS Boxer, 
ships built to conduct amphibious landings, are excellent soft power 
providers: they contain massive medical facilities. These onboard 
hospitals were not originally designed to provide free surgeries to 
Nicaraguan children, but to give first rate trauma care to Marines 
storming the beach.</p>
<p>The building of a Japanese hospital ship could very easily be seen by
 its neighbors as preparation for a more militarily aggressive foreign 
policy. Many would argue the same should be said about <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/chinas-new-hospital-ship/">China’s new hospital ship</a>.
 Yes, it could conduct soft power operations, but it could also provide 
vital medical services during any amphibious invasion of Taiwan.</p>

included no such references to stopping “mass atrocities” as a military 
imperative. It was a quiet victory for advocates of a new vision of U.S.
 national power that would make genocide prevention a military priority.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.msf-crash.org/sur-le-vif/2010/05/04/355/nato-and-the-ngos-honeymoon-over/">NATO and the NGOs: honeymoon over</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The alliance between the international forces, the Afghan
 government, and the NGOs had its virtues as long as NATO forces still 
had the military advantage and controlled nearly 90% of Afghan 
territory. Up until 2005, the NGOs “embedded” in the “reconstruction of 
Afghanistan” were able to establish themselves in the wake of the 
international troops and their local allies, without worrying too much 
about the reaction of the then extremely weakened opposition.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.cnas.org/node/4423">The Rebirth of USAID</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The restoration of USAID will take herculean reform and 
uncommon patience, if it is even possible at all. No doubt leaking the 
Presidential Study Directive this week, in advance of the National 
Security Strategy and months before the completion of the Quadrennial 
Diplomacy and Development Review, was deliberate. The Obama 
administration (or at least a portion of it) figures it can stake out 
its agenda (and perhaps claim on resources) before the rest of the 
interagency consumes all of the policy and budget oxygen inside the 
Beltway. As with development itself, however, this directive will only 
be as good or bad as its implementation, and on that score there are 
many questions that will need to be addressed.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.undispatch.com/humanitarian-aid-warmongers-best-friend">Humanitarian Aid: A Warmonger’s Best Friend?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>If Polman’s Guardian interview is any indication, her 
book will be a huge hit for taking extreme positions and providing a 
wealth of quotable quotes. At one point, she is asked how she would 
describe the aid agencies that provided relief to Rwandan Hutus, many of
 them genocidaires but plenty also ordinary civilians, who fled into the
 now Democratic Republic of Congo in the wake of the Rwandan genocide. 
Polman’s response? “Perhaps war criminals.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">N</span>ATO has taken flak for the last few 
years for the numbers of civilian casualties occurring in the 
Afghanistan campaign. With the war’s military leadership, especially 
General Stanley McChrystal, emphasizing the need to win the support and 
confidence of the civilian population, there has been serious pressure 
on commanders to limit civilian deaths whenever possible. Despite this, 
civilian deaths have risen in the country since last year.</p>
<p>Now, NATO has come up with a new plan to reduce civilian casualties: <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iSS-2PRFQjee-ZAKgqrSmqBNg4gQD9FFTF6O0">The Courageous Restraint Medal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, the NATO commander of 
troops in southern Afghanistan, proposed the idea of awarding soldiers 
for “courageous restraint” during a visit by Hall to Kandahar Airfield 
in mid April. McChrystal is now reviewing the proposal to determine how 
it could be implemented, Hall said.” …</p>
<p>“There should be an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the troops
 who exhibit extraordinary courage and self-control by not using their 
weapons, but instead taking personal risk to de-escalate tense and 
potentially disastrous situations,” the statement said.” …</p>
<p>“NATO commanders are not planning to create a new medal or military 
decoration for “courageous restraint,” but instead are looking at ways 
of using existing awards to recognize soldiers who go to great lengths 
to avoid civilian casualties, Hall said.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so maybe there is not really going to be a medal, but still, 
recognizing restraint in combat? That is a world away from traditional 
medals which highlight martial qualities.</p>
<p>Will it work? Not a chance.</p>
<p>I typically avoid discussing internal Armed Services politics for a 
simple reason: I am not in the military. However, nothing in my 
experience with servicemen and women leads me to believe they want to 
celebrate ‘restraint’. There is a poignant Marine Corps saying, 
attributed to a Korean War veteran: “Never send a Marine  where you can 
send a bullet, and the bigger the bullet the better”. Any act of 
courageous restraint, by definition, sends Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, 
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen in first. And there lies the problem. 
Winning a medal for courageous restraint would be a scarlet letter, 
warning that the owner put his subordinates or compatriots at risk when 
he did not need to, when a bullet would do.</p>
<p>There are ways to reduce civilian casualties, but this is not one of them.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span> heap of interesting news articles and
 blog posts were published last week. Here is a few to enjoy with your 
monday morning coffee.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.undispatch.com/rape-weapon-war">Rape As A Weapon Of War</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Michel Martin of National Public Radio spotlights UN 
efforts to combat rape as a tactic of warfare.  She interviews Margot 
Wallstrom, the Special Representative for Sexual Violence in 
Conflict–the first person to hold the position.  “If we can ban cluster 
bombs, we can ban rape as a weapon of conflict.” </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/22/in_praise_of_aerial_bombing">In Praise of Aerial Bombing</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Ever since the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey cast doubt 
on the efficacy of aerial bombardment in World War II, and particularly 
after its failure to bring victory in the Vietnam War, air power has 
acquired a bad reputation. Nowadays, killing enemies from the skies is 
widely considered useless, while its polar opposite, counterinsurgency 
by nation-building, is the U.S. government’s official policy. But it’s 
not yet time to junk our planes. Air power still has a lot to offer, 
even in a world of scattered insurgencies. </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/20441/pandemic_influenza.html">Pandemic Influenza: Science, Economics, and Foreign Policy: Session Three: Foreign Policy</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>This session was part of a CFR symposium, Pandemic 
Influenza: Science, Economics, and Foreign Policy, which was cosponsored
 with Science Magazine.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/markurban/2010/04/have_helmand_troops_been_told.html">Have Helmand troops been told to lie low during election?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Britain has not lost a soldier in Afghanistan since the 
day after Gordon Brown called the general election – that’s more than 
three weeks. </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.undispatch.com/node/9823">UN Evacuates Some Staff From Embattled Kandahar: What About Those Left Behind? </a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The awful reality is, national staff are far more 
vulnerable than their international colleagues, especially in 
deteriorating places like Kandahar.  They must live amongst their 
prospective killers, without the physical protections afforded to 
expatriates. I believe that, if a situation is dangerous enough for 
internationals to be evacuated, national staff should at least be given 
the option of leaving as well, even if that could mean them resettling 
elsewhere permanently. I hope the UN is giving its national staff in 
Afghanistan this choice. Does anyone know if it is? </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.undispatch.com/node/9821">Mass Sickness of Afghan Schoolgirls Raises Poisoning Fears</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Since April 21, at least eighty Afghan schoolgirls at 
three schools in the increasingly violent northern city of Kunduz have 
mysteriously fallen ill after reporting a strange smell in their 
classrooms. Most of the affected girls have been hospitalized briefly 
and released, but the sudden, mysterious epidemic of fainting and nausea
 is raising fears of poisoning by opponents of girls’ education.</p></blockquote>

 Her deployment will last until late September during which riders and 
crew will conduct health and construction missions in Vietnam, Cambodia,
 Indonesia, and Timor-Leste. Mercy’s 500 riders include both military 
and NGO volunteers, including health workers from <a href="http://www.interplast.org/">InterPlast</a>, <a href="http://www.irteams.org/">International Relief Teams</a>, International Aid, <a href="http://www.lolomafoundation.org/">Loloma Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.projecthope.org/">Project HOPE</a>, <a href="http://www.rotary.org/">Rotary International</a>, <a href="http://www.shrinershq.org/">Shriners</a>, University of California at San Diego Pre-Dental Society, and <a href="http://www.worldvets.org/">World Vets</a>.
 In addition, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Japan, South Korea, New

hospital ship’s mission.</p>
<p>Pacific Partnership was born after the US military’s response to the 
 2004 tsunami. After realizing the capacity of health diplomacy to win 
friends and allies, US Pacific Fleet  decided to follow up Unified 
Endeavor by sending the Mercy back to  the region in 2006. Pacific 
Partnership 2010 is the fifth time the  humanitarian civic assistance 
operation to been conducted.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week Harper’s interviewed Gary Solis, Georgetown University Law Center professor and author of <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521870887">The Law of Armed Conflict</a>, on the <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2010/04/hbc-90006912">legality of some of the United States’ more controversial actions in recent years</a>. This includes a legal take on the events surrounding the <a href="http://www.harpers.org/subjects/NoComment#hbc-90006829">Wikileaks video released a few weeks ago</a> showing a U.S. Army helicopter mistaking two groups of civilians as combatants and killing them.</p>
<p>While all of Professor Solis’ interview is useful to students of war, it is the last question really hit home for me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>6. Do you expect to see the law of armed conflict 
change to more closely address conflicts involving nonstate actors, like
 terrorist groups?</em></p>
<p>Yes, such changes seem inevitable. The Geneva Conventions remain 
vital and viable in the “war on terrorism,” but in the foreseeable 
future conflicts will likely continue to be between states and non-state
 actors. Such conflicts are not directly addressed in the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions. Considering specific issues of non-international armed 
conflict, and new weapons and tactics that currently vex combatants and 
commentators alike, will make battlefield options less subject to 
individual national interpretation. For example, what armed response if 
any is appropriate to cross-border terrorist attacks? Will white 
phosphorus munitions be banned? Can there be international agreement on 
the lawfulness of targeting civilian communication facilities? What is 
the status of captured members of armed opposition groups? Should 
depleted uranium munitions be prohibited?</p></blockquote>
<p>Solis’ is correct. Western countries spend large amounts of money and
 time educating their militaries on the laws of war, yet those soldiers 
are increasingly faced with situations not discussed in the Geneva 
Convention or elsewhere. Given this, and given that nonstate actors 
(accounting for more than half of combatants) are not beholden to the 
rules of war, the Geneva Convention’s applicability to modern war is 
rapidly and tragically decreasing.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">E</span>arly this week, much of South Africa 
was disconnected from the internet due to a problem with an undersea 
cable. For this reason there was no new posts on Conflict Health. 
However, everything is now back up and working and here is a list of the
 stories I missed last week. Enjoy.</p>
<h3><a href="http://isnblog.ethz.ch/security/our-business-trafficking-weapons-delivering-aid">Our Business: Trafficking Weapons, Delivering Aid</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The global transport industry plays a crucial role in 
conflict economies. Ethical Cargo, a new information portal by one of 
our partners, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 
(SIPRI), sheds light on this role and helps donors to choose the right 
companies when giving out contracts.
</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/health/25warrior.html?hp">Feeling Warehoused in Army Trauma Care Units</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>But interviews with more than a dozen soldiers and health
 care professionals from Fort Carson’s transition unit, along with 
reports from other posts, suggest that the units are far from being 
restful sanctuaries. For many soldiers, they have become warehouses of 
despair, where damaged men and women are kept out of sight, fed a diet 
of powerful prescription pills and treated harshly by noncommissioned 
officers. Because of their wounds, soldiers in Warrior Transition Units 
are particularly vulnerable to depression and addiction, but many 
soldiers from Fort Carson’s unit say their treatment there has made 
their suffering worse. </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.registan.net/index.php/2010/04/25/how-to-write-about-afghanistan/">How to Write About Afghanistan</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Always use the word ‘war-torn’ in your title. Subtitles 
may include the words ‘tribal,’ ‘Taliban,’ ‘corrupt,’ and ‘Sharia.’ Also
 useful are words such as ‘shuras,’ ‘fighters,’ ‘refugees’ and 
‘insurgency.’ Do not distinguish between different ethnic groups with 
different languages, religions and histories, or regions with different 
landscapes and livelihoods. If people in Kandahar tell you something, 
assume people in Kabul feel the same way, and vice versa. Whenever 
possible, mention Pashtunwali. (Note: you do not need to understand what
 Pashtunwali is. You get points for mentioning it anyway.)</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/world/27powerpoint.html?ref=world">We Have Met the Enemy and He Is PowerPoint</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>“PowerPoint makes us stupid,” Gen. James N. Mattis of the
 Marine Corps, the Joint Forces commander, said this month at a military
 conference in North Carolina. (He spoke without PowerPoint.) Brig. Gen.
 H. R. McMaster, who banned PowerPoint presentations when he led the 
successful effort to secure the northern Iraqi city of Tal Afar in 2005,
 followed up at the same conference by likening PowerPoint to an 
internal threat. </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/04/1889-russian-flu-pandemic/#ixzz0mJJUUoA0">1889 Pandemic Didn’t Need Planes to Circle Globe in 4 Months</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The 1889 Russian flu pandemic circled the globe in just 
four months, captivating the world, despite the lack of airplanes or 
hyperventilating cable news stations.</p>
<p>If that was possible, closing down air traffic in the event of a new 
pandemic might not do much, argue the authors led by Alain-Jacques 
Valleron, an epidemiologist at the Institut National de la Santé et de 
la Recherche Médicale in Paris.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n early March, the Department of Defense <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/military-publishes-%E2%80%9Chumanitarians-101%E2%80%9D/">published a “humanitarians 101″ handbook</a>.
 The work is a primer for the military on how to interact with 
humanitarians and other NGOs, especially in the field. Last week at the 
World Bank’s Innovation Fair, I had the opportunity to have some beers 
with <a href="http://www.laurawhudson.com/">Laura Hudson</a> of <a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/">FrontlineSMS</a>
 on humanitarian-military relations  in the UK’s Ministry of Defense. 
Laura knows her stuff, and pointed out that the MoD’s Development, 
Concepts, and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) had previously published their own 
guide to NGOs, titled <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/MicroSite/DCDC/OurPublications/Concepts/SharingTheSpaceAGuideToConstructiveEngagementWithNongovernmentalOrganisationsAndTheAidCommunity.htm">Sharing The Space</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sharing the Space aims to be a back-pocket guide for 
personnel operating alongside civilian organisations, providing advice 
on the likely roles, motivations and methods of NGOs. Greater 
understanding of their civilian counterparts in theatre should lead to 
an appropriate dialogue between the military and aid organisations.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can download a PDF of Sharing The Space <a href="http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/973644D9-EBA9-4EA8-BDC1-AD2DFCEA3BC8/0/20091111SharingtheSpaceUDCDCIMAPPS.pdf">here</a>.</p>

 The collection includes over 2000 variables gathered by the World Bank

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>f anyone needed more evidence that the rules of war have little sway in AfPak, <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=88847">early this week Taliban fighters attacked a Pakistan an IDP camp in Pakistan’s North West Frontier Province</a>.
 The attack allegedly consisted of two suicide bombers and killed 41 
IDPs. In response, the United Nations has been forced to suspend relief 
operations in that area of the troubled country.</p>
<blockquote><p>The motive behind the bombing is unclear, but Kohat 
police chief Dilawar Khan Bangash said “it seems the purpose was to 
target members of the Manikhel and Baramadkhel tribes who had 
constituted a large percentage of those fleeing recently”.</p>
<p>He said the bombers, who had disguised themselves by wearing loose 
‘burqas’, could have been seeking “revenge” as members of those tribes 
had raised a militia to fight Taliban militants in their areas. 
According to media reports, militant outfits based in Punjab Province in
 the east took responsibility for the blasts.</p>
<p>“We are not safe. At home we face death and when we try to find 
safety by leaving our homes, we confront death here too,” Kharan Khan, a
 60-year-old IDP in Kohat, told IRIN. He described “scenes of mayhem and
 chaos” as the bombers struck an area where IDPs were queuing to collect
 food rations.</p></blockquote>
<p>In modern war, neutrality offers little protection, both to those providing humanitarians assistance and those needing it.</p>

<p><em>This is the third in an excellent series of guest posts by <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/Pubs/people.cfm?authorID=692">Paul Rexton Kan</a>. The <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/warning-black-market-cigarettes-may-be-hazardous-to-countries-in-conflict/">first</a> and <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/%E2%80%9Cpeak-insurgency%E2%80%9D-39-and-the-new-abnormal/">second</a> articles explored drugs in warfare and peak insurgency. Kan also recently contributed to a special issue of <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title%7Edb=all%7Econtent=g919842612%7Etab=toc">Small Wars and Insurgency</a>.</em></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he ongoing drug cartel violence in 
Mexico took an ominous turn last month. While the killings of two 
Americans who were consular employees in Ciudad Juarez was a serious 
escalation, even more troubling was an event that took place several 
miles away and several days later. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/us/18border.html?hp">Thirty people of the small Mexican town of El Porvenir walked the 860 yards to the US border</a>,
 crossed it and went to a small Texas town of Ft. Hancock to seek 
political asylum from an explicit cartel threat. The threat was simple 
as it was cruel—leave before the outbreak of a gang war or your children
 will be targets…unless you provide 5000 pesos per child for protection.
 The gang was able to purge the town of human obstacles and earn money 
for weapons from those who could afford to pay the extortion money.</p>
<p>Political asylum cases are not new, but those who qualify are 
targeted for their political beliefs or ethnicity in countries that are 
typically repressive or coming apart. Mexico is neither and the reason 
people are being targeted in Mexico by cartels and gangs is not for what
 they believe or for who they are, but for what they do—police who 
investigate crimes; mayors who govern towns; journalists who write about
 the violence. And now people are being targeted merely because they are
 in the way, because of where they live.</p>
<p>If such acts of criminal cleansing are repeated and sustained, US 
communities will feel an even greater burden on their systems of public 
safety and public health from “narco-refugees”.</p>
<p>Given the ever increasing cruelty of the cartels, the question is 
whether and how the US should begin to prepare for what could be a new 
wave of people like those whose hometown of El Porvenir is Spanish for 
“the future”.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>or those that did not know, I was in Cape Town for the World Bank’s Fragile State <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/conflict/moving-beyond-conflict">Innovation Fair</a>
 and thus not able to post on Conflict Health. More on the conference 
later, but for now, here is some articles I enjoyed while in Cape Town.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704655004575114623837930294.html#mod=todays_us_page_one">On Battlefields, Survival Odds Rise </a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan, medical experts say,
 are still emerging. One legacy is new ways to control bleeding before 
soldiers lapse into comas or their vital organs shut down. Thanks to new
 clotting agents, blood products and advanced medical procedures 
performed closer to the battlefield, wounded American soldiers are now 
surviving at a greater rate than in any previous war fought by the U.S.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It’s the latest in a series of deadly “escalation of 
force” incidents that have caused civilian outrage. Gen. Stanley 
McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has issued guidance 
that makes it clear to troops on the ground that they need to do their 
utmost to avoid civilian casualties, even if it means more risks in the 
short term.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2010/04/15/war-kills-coin-kills-fewer/">War Kills; COIN Kills Fewer</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>But I don’t know how you can wage a war that does not 
involve civilian casualties, which is one of the reasons war is a 
wretched thing that should be avoided when the national interest is not 
implicated, and I don’t know how you can neglect the reduced proportion 
of U.S.-caused deaths when evaluating the success of a strategy that 
seeks to get that civilian-casualty-causation figure down. No one I have
 ever encountered who has waged, studied or advocated for 
counterinsurgency has made the case that counterinsurgency is a kinder 
or gentler method of warfare, or that it’s no more than development work
 with an M4. They tend instead to use phrases like the “brotherhood of 
the close fight” to underscore just how nasty and brutal it actually is.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In a follow-on article for the same publication entitled,
 “More Henderson, Less Bonds,” the officer argues more forcefully for a 
Navy that can have a wider, more persistent presence across the globe, 
even at the expense of firepower. Hendrix compares today’s 9,000-ton 
destroyers and 100,000-ton aircraft carriers to American baseball player
 Barry Bonds, a homerun-hitter who commanded a multi-million-dollar 
salary. Smaller, more numerous ships he likens to Ricky Henderson, a 
less famous baseball player who quietly and reliably scored runs through
 less dramatic hits that earned him a high on-base percentage.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">E</span>arlier this week, Tom Ricks’ Best Defense blog <a href="http://ricks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/04/05/the_best_defense_interview_petraeus_on_not_running_for_president_pirates_president_">posted an interview</a>
 with General David Petraeus. In the interview, the CENTCOM Commander 
was asked what books he recommended to his staff. His answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>The last one I recommended was Stones into Schools. 
Beyond that, at present, we’re focused on a number of official 
reports/analyses; they’re keeping us occupied for the time being. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is an unconventional choice for one of America’s top military minds, considering the book’s full title is “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670021156?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=warandhea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0670021156">Stones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Books, Not Bombs, in Afghanistan and Pakistan</a><img src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/ir_002.gif" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" border="0" height="1" width="1">“.
 I cannot imagine Patton recommending a book on improving the lives of 
children in his battlespace. Of course, I am not complaining. It is 
great to see that Petraeus looks outside the military-intellectual box 
for insights into soft power. Now, if only he read Conflict Health.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n the 1960s, political scientist 
Kenneth Boulding argued that military power was depleted by geographic 
distance. The cost of logistics and long range weapon development meant 
that most states are exceptionally limited in their ability to project 
power. In other words, Belize has little to fear from Mozambique’s 
military power. Called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_Strength_Gradient">loss of strength gradient</a>,
 Boulding’s theory refined how global strategists thought about power. 
Last week, Halvard Buhaug published a brilliant extension of Boulding’s 
theory by applying loss of strength gradients to civil wars 
(unfortunately it is gated):</p>
<blockquote><p>“I argue that a significant factor influencing the 
location of civil wars relative to the capital city is the power 
distribution between the state and the non-state actors. In countries 
where the state is strong—typically in institutionally consistent and 
wealthy regimes—or the rebels are very weak, emerging conflicts are 
likely to occur in the remote periphery. Weaker states pose less of a 
threat to armed non-governmental groups and may not be able to exert 
force outside urban areas, so in such countries the battles are expected
 to take place closer to the state’s home base.” (Buhaung 2010, 108)</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a quick graphic I created demonstrating Buhaug’s theory:</p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/where-my-war.png" alt="where-my-war.png" class="frame" border="0" height="452" width="558"></p>
<p>Buhaug’s paper is no less than a first attempt to predict the areas 
of a country most likely to be affected by political violence. Developed
 more, the theory could help the international community identify 
regions most at risk during intrastate armed conflict. I am looking 
forward to see how this vein of research pans out.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span>special thanks is due to <a href="http://www.alannashaikh.com/">Alanna Shaikh</a> for introducing me to <a href="http://www.alannashaikh.com/">AidData</a>. AidData, currently in beta, offers financial data on organizations in the development sector.</p>
<blockquote><p>The core of the AidData database currently encompasses 
multilateral and bilateral donor projects spanning the years 1945-2009. 
It contains information from traditional aid sources such as the OECD’s 
Creditor Reporting System (CRS) as well as donors not captured by the 
CRS and activities that do not fit the OECD definition of Official 
Development Assistance (ODA). AidData augments existing data by 
publishing more complete project descriptions and more detailed aid 
project purpose codes. In particular, AidData is dedicated to collecting
 project-level data from all multilateral donors and non-DAC bilateral 
donors (NDBs) to provide a more complete picture of development finance 
flows and activities. This resource will allow donor organizations, 
citizens in donor countries, researchers, NGOs, recipient governments, 
and, ultimately, the beneficiaries on the ground in developing countries
 to gain a more detailed understanding of past and present trends in 
aid.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hoarding of data, especially financial data, by NGOs is a huge 
problem in the development world. Despite all the hype over openness, 
many NGOs continue to keep their data closed to outsiders for little 
reason. Hopefully projects like AidData will give us a peak inside these
 organizations and their activities.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he <a href="http://www.informationdissemination.net/2009/03/plan-asbm-development.html">Chinese antiship ballistic-missile (ASBM)</a>
 has garnered immense attention from the media and military thinkers in 
recent months. Most of this punditry has varied only in the level of 
sheer terror at the thought of these “carrier killers”. In this month’s 
Proceedings, fellow USNI blog contributor <a href="http://nextnavy.com/">Craig Hooper</a> and <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/">myself</a> argue <a href="http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/story.asp?STORY_ID=2313">for a different perspective</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By focusing on the distant question of supercarrier 
vulnerability, naval analysts forfeited an ideal opportunity to frame 
the ASBM threat as a shared regional hazard. In Cold War Europe, 
farsighted strategists wasted no time in portraying Russia’s 
medium-range RT-21M Pioneer/SS-20 Saber missile as a European-wide 
threat. But today, despite the domestic uproar over this Asian “game 
changer,” the U.S. Navy and State Department might do well to exploit 
the ASBM threat in a similar fashion.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best counter to China’s ASBM is diplomacy, not fear mongering.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n March 18th, American military health personnel in Bagram <a href="http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123198047">removed</a> a 4.5 mm high explosive incendiary round lodged in the skull of an Afghan National Army soldier. The photo above is real.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Initially I thought it was a spent end of some sort of 
larger round,” said Colonel Terreri, who is also deployed from the 
Wilford Hall Medical Center.</p>
<p>“I saw that it was not solid metal on the inside,” he added. “I then 
looked at the scout image and could see there was an air gap on one end 
and what looked almost like the tip of a tube of lipstick at the end and
 decided this didn’t look quite right.”</p>
<p>Colonel Terreri, a native of Tonopah, Nev., explained when reviewing 
scans, the radiologist may come across images that reveal information 
for which the surgical team must be prepared for, and a unexploded 
ordnance is one of those cases.</p>
<p>He immediately went to inform the neurosurgeon who had already left to prepare for surgery.</p>
<p>“I went directly to the operating room and evacuated all unnecessary 
personnel,” Major Bini said. “I had the anesthesiologist remain in the 
room in his Interceptor Body Armor to monitor the patient.”</p>
<p>Major Bini then notified his chain of command and the explosives 
ordnance disposal team and began to secure areas of the hospital to 
protect patients and staff.</p>
<p>To add another twist to this already intense situation, Major Bini 
explained there was another surgical team operating on a patient with 
multiple life threatening injuries in another operating room and they 
couldn’t safely evacuate as the patient was in critical condition.</p>
<p>“It was kind of a case of Murphy’s Law coming into play,” said Tech. 
Sgt. William Carter, the 455th EMDG/TF MED-E NCO in charge of central 
sterile processing and a medical technician deployed from 
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. “We had an (operating room) full of trauma 
cases and we had people in other rooms who were busy taking care of 
patients and it was really an all hands on deck event.”</p>
<p>Sergeant Carter explained one of the greatest difficulties the teams 
in the other operating rooms faced was the ability to pass through the 
cordoned area to gain lab work and blood products.</p>
<p>“We donned our IBA and made sure the individuals in the other 
operating room did not have to pass through the area and had everything 
they needed,” he said.</p>
<p>He referred to it as a tag team effort and the team ensured their 
ultimate goal, which is to save lives, could still be accomplished.</p>
<p>When the explosive ordnance disposal team arrived at the hospital, 
Major Bini took them to review the CAT scan images. He then proceeded to
 the operating room, donned his IBA and removed the round from the 
patient’s head.</p>
<p>After the unexploded ordnance was removed from the patient and given 
to EOD, the areas were reopened to normal operating room traffic. Major 
Bini turned the operation over to the neurosurgeon and the operating 
room team to complete the operation. </p></blockquote>

<p>The video appears to depict a case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>
 by the American helicopter pilots. Confirmation bias is the tendency of
 the human mind to unconsciously prefer information reinforcing existing
 beliefs. In this case, the fact the pilots were looking for armed 
insurgents made them predisposed to believe that any item carried by the
 persons were weapons.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8587305.stm">BBC has uncovered evidence of 321 people killed</a>
 in a border raid by the Lords Resistance Army last December. The BBC 
story outlines the tragic massacre and the inability of the UN forces to
 protect the population. However, what caught my eye was this map 
detailing the raid:</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8587305.stm"><img src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/lra-raid-map.gif" alt="lra-raid-map.gif" class="frame" border="0" height="300" width="466"></a></p>
<p>From the map we can extrapolate (guess) some LRC techniques and strategies.</p>
<p>1. It is a raid in the purest form. The route is clearly designed to 
hit as many minor population centers in as short amount of time as 
possible. The main thrust occurs towards and then onto Poko Road, 
increasing the speed at which the attackers can travel. The raiders were
 planning on using speed and surprise to overcome any resistance from 
the government forces or peacekeepers. </p>
<p>2. The raiders likely split up. Notice on the first two days the raid
 made four attacks a piece. That is incredibly fast given the distance 
involved. According to the map key, the distance between the farthest 
two attacks on the first day is approximately 60-70km. That is too far 
for a single raid group to cover, especially considering that they are 
“country miles”.</p>
<p>3. The main operation (eight attacks) occurred in the first two days.
 The remaining three days involved only two additional attacks, either 
from fear of counterattack or being weighed down with loot and 
prisoners. Geographically, it is a shallow raid, the attackers are never
 far from the safety of the river, especially if they left a force in 
Mavanzongda to cover their backs.</p>
<p>I make no claim to expertise in military strategy or operations, and I
 hope readers with more knowledge in this area will be able to shed some
 light on the anatomy of the raid.</p>
<p>Here is a satellite view of the river crossing:</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>riend of the blog Patrick Clarkin has <a href="http://kevishere.wordpress.com/2010/02/24/the-lingering-effects-of-the-war-in-laos/">published a brilliant and indepth discussion</a>
 on a Lao National Regulatory Authority report on unexploded ordnance 
(UXO) in the country. The report puts plainly the long term danger of 
UXOs:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is particularly significant from the LNRA report is 
that 40% of recorded casualties actually occurred after 1973, the year 
that bombing ceased. The nature of the bombing campaign, in particular 
the near indiscriminate use of cluster bombs, meant that it was 
inevitable that massive amounts of ordnance would remain in Laos for 
decades. Khamvongsa and Russell (2009) note that between 1996- 2006, 
removal teams had cleared approximately 144 km2 of land, or just 1% of 
high-risk areas and only .04% of total contaminated land. In a 2009 
AlertNet article by Thin Lei Win, Boddington stated that “after 15 years
 of official clearance operations, we have managed to clear about 
400,000 (of an estimated 80 million cluster bombs still in Laos). If you
 do the sums, you’ll find that in order to clear all of the bombs in 
this country, it will take 3,000 years.”  Think about that. Meanwhile, 
the number of UXO casualties remains around 250 people per year into the
 present, 37 years after the bombing campaign officially ended.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an era of aging cold-war cluster munition stockpiles, there is a 
serious lesson to learned from a country tragically well experienced in 
the perils of UXOs. The lesson should be particularly pertinent to 
Israel. One IDF commander <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/761781.html">claimed Israeli forces</a>
 “fired around 1,800 cluster bombs, containing over 1.2 million cluster 
bomblets” during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, of which a <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/israeli-use-of-cluster-munitions/">significant proportion</a> did not detonate on impact.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, journalists and academics <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/03/books-which-have-influenced-me-most.html">posted the ten books that most influenced them</a>.
 Putting a twist on that idea, I present seven works (articles and 
books) that have been seminal in the development of my own thinking on 
armed conflict and public health.</p>
<p><cite>Azam, Jean-Paul, And Anke Hoeffler. 2002. “<a href="http://jpr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/39/4/461">Violence Against Civilians in Civil Wars: Looting or Terror?</a>.” Journal of Peace Research 39(4):461-485.</cite></p>
<p>While not directly related to public health, Azam and Hoeffler (2002)
 present a causal mechanism between the political conditions of conflict
 and deliberate violence against civilians. The authors combine a game 
theoretic model with a statistical analysis of African refugee data to 
conclude that violence against civilians is often part of a larger, 
purposeful military strategy.</p>
<p><cite>Ghobarah, Hazem Adam, Paul Huth, and Bruce Russett. 2003. “<a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=152166&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0003055403000613">Civil Wars Kill and Maim People-Long after the Shooting Stops</a>.” The American Political Science Review 97(2):189-202.</cite></p>
<p>Ghobarah et al. (2003) is one of the few attempts to bring public 
health into political science conflict research. The authors, publishing
 in political science’s top journal, find that armed conflict negatively
 impacts health after the war has concluded. More importantly, the 
article is an initial attempt to reconcile the data and literatures of 
both fields.</p>
<p><cite>Kaldor, Mary. 2007. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Human-Security-Mary-Kaldor/dp/0745638546/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269075527&amp;sr=8-3">Human Security</a>. Polity.</cite></p>
<p>Mary Kaldor’s book is a collection of seven essays describing the 
historical context, theoretical foundations, and development of human 
security as a concept. Human security is part of an attempt by a growing
 number of political scientists to study conflict from the perspective 
of populations rather than states. This sub-discipline is also the most 
open to incorporating public health into concepts of security.</p>
<p><cite>Levy, Barry S., and Victor W. Sidel. 2000. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Public-Health-Barry-Levy/dp/0195311272/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269075558&amp;sr=8-1">War and Public Health</a>. American Public Health Association.</cite></p>
<p>The edited volume is a collection of core readings of the public 
health during armed conflict. While informative, the works contained are
 largely normative appeals as to the importance of health during 
conflict.</p>
<p><cite>Murray, C J L et al. 2002. “<a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7333/346">Armed conflict as a public health problem</a>.” BMJ 324(7333):346-349.</cite></p>
<p>In the article, political scientist Gary King and three 
epidemiologists discuss the basic concept of war as a negative health 
consequence, the problems acquiring information on the health impact of 
war, and propose new and better measures of the health impact of armed 
conflict. Most importantly, the authors call for greater collaboration 
between political scientists and public health experts to better 
understand the dynamic between health and conflict. The article is not a
 research project but rather an attempt to publicize the gap in research
 regarding armed conflict and public health.</p>
<p><cite>Prinzing, Friedrich. 1916. <a href="http://books.google.co.za/books?id=YQhAAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Epidemics+Resulting+from+Wars&amp;dq=Epidemics+Resulting+from+Wars&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E69AoyiUlZ&amp;sig=mI2NkTEvZ_qNFYGd0rM9gBwzKik&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p46kS9WhKI754Aau_eGACg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAw">Epidemics Resulting from Wars</a>.</cite></p>
<p>Friedrich Prinzing’s book is one of the first major studies of public
 health during armed conflict. The author, writing during the first half
 of World War I, systematically describes epidemics during more than 
twenty wars. Prinzing offers few theories regard the relationship; 
rather he presents a historical overview of wartime epidemics. This work
 is the intellectual parent of Smallman-Raynor and Cliff’s 2004 seminal 
book.</p>
<p><cite>Smallman-Raynor, M. R., and A. D. Cliff. 2004. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Epidemics-Historical-Geographical-Environmental/dp/0198233647/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269075647&amp;sr=8-1">War Epidemics: An Historical Geography of Infectious Diseases in Military Conflict and Civil Strife, 1850-2000</a>. Oxford University Press, USA.</cite></p>
<p>Smallman-Raynor and Cliff’s 2004 book is a comprehensive review of 
infectious disease epidemics during and after armed conflict throughout 
modern history. This seminal work uses both historical accounts and 
modern statistical analyses to describe the behavior of war-related 
epidemics. However, similar to Prinzing’s 1916 book, the authors develop
 few  theories on the causal relationship between conflict and 
epidemics. Rather, they focus on presenting a detailed descriptive 
account of the phenomenon.</p>

<blockquote><p>During the 1980s, I had regular contact with guerrilla 
groups in the Horn of Africa, such as the TPLF (including its 
humanitarian wing, Rest), the EPLF and ELF. I also reported from the 
government side out of Addis. All did their best to dupe both aid 
workers and journalists.</p>
<p>Rest, for example, was extremely well organised. It provided 
impressive humanitarian surveys, such as the number of lactating mothers
 in specific villages and refugee camps. However, there was no way of 
verifying whether all the aid was actually going through or not. Inside 
the guerrilla zones Rest always controlled what you saw and where you 
travelled. The Ethiopian Dergue did exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>Everything was elaborate while the show was on, but the moment one 
left it was a different matter. Once I visited a bustling “government 
displaced centre” near the Sudanese border. Twenty minutes after leaving
 I returned because I had forgotten my jacket. The camp was empty. It 
had been a complete charade in a bid to solicit international sympathy 
and funding.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Today’s guest post is the second by <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/Pubs/people.cfm?authorID=692">Paul  Rexton Kan</a> of the U.S. Army War College. Kan recently contributed to a special issue of <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title%7Edb=all%7Econtent=g919842612%7Etab=toc">Small Wars and Insurgency</a>.</em></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>here have been two articles that could
 be read together as one study on the near future of conflicts.  In the 
current edition of Foreign Policy magazine, “<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/11/peak_insurgency">Peak Insurgency</a>”
 by Joshua Keating covers the research of two Yale political scientists 
who conclude that the number of insurgencies worldwide has actually 
declined since 1991.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://jpr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/41/3/275">a study by James Fearon</a>
 concluded that civil wars last 39  years longer when the belligerents 
are actively involved in illicit activities, primarily cocaine and 
heroin trafficking.</p>
<p>Are the terror groups and insurgent movements currently active in the
 world those that will be part of the international security landscape 
for the foreseeable future?   Phil Cerny describes this landscape as 
“durable disorder”; Phil Williams, “the new Dark Ages” and the US Army ,
 “the era of persistent conflict”.   This is the “new abnormal” school 
that sees violent non-state actors and asymmetric threats as a type of 
fixed magnetic north for security studies.  Future research, new 
policies and novel strategies can be plotted by focusing on the 
assessments that are embraced by this school.</p>
<p>I count myself as one of the adherents of the new abnormal.  But 
anything abnormal still rests on a conception of what is “normal”; 
trends come in bunches and patches.  The question should not be about 
what the near future holds, but how we avoid becoming conventional in 
our thinking about the unconventional.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>wo Marines from the 22nd Marine 
Expeditionary Unit in Haiti have contracted malaria. Cases of malaria 
are usually non-stories. However, <a href="http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=68663">Seth Robson from Stars and Stripes is reporting</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Marines in Carrefour said they’ve been told they could 
face nonjudicial punishment, for disobeying an order to take their daily
 anti-malaria pills, if they contract the disease.</p>
<p>Cargile said the decision to punish a servicemember in such 
circumstances would be up to individual unit commanders based on the 
circumstances of each case.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the anti-malaria pill (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline">doxycycline</a>)
 to be effective, it must be taken daily. Missing a single pill leaves 
you vulnerable. I am assuming the commanders are considering contracting
 malaria as a signal that their orders to take the pill daily were not 
followed.</p>
<p>Personally, I imagine getting malaria is punishment enough.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n the early 1990s, General Colin 
Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented a vision of
 military action based around using overwhelming force as a last resort 
to achieve attainable goal of vital national security interest, all with
 a clear exit strategy. Called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell_Doctrine">Powell Doctrine</a>,
 it has shaped American use of force for twenty years. Now, the current 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, has outlined a 
new doctrine for the use of the military in international affairs. 
Spencer Ackerman calls it the <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/79299/the-mullen-doctrine-takes-shape">Mullen Doctrine</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps Mullen’s most provocative “principle,” as he 
called it in the speech, is that military forces “should not – maybe 
cannot – be the last resort of the state.” On the surface, Mullen 
appeared to offer a profligate view of sending troops to battle, 
contradicting the Powell Doctrine’s warning that the military should 
only be used when all other options exhaust themselves. Powell’s warning
 has great appeal to a country exhausted by two costly, protracted wars,
 one of which was launched long before diplomatic options had run out.</p>
<p>But Mullen’s aides said the chairman was trying to make a subtler 
point, one that envisioned the deployment of military forces not as a 
sharp change in strategy from diplomacy but along a continuum of 
strategy alongside it. “The American people are used to thinking of war 
and peace as two very distinct activities,” said Air Force Col. Jim 
Baker, one of Mullen’s advisers for military strategy. “That is not 
always the case.” In the speech, Mullen focused his definition of 
military force on the forward deployment of troops or hardware to 
bolster diplomatic efforts or aid in humanitarian ones, rather than the 
invasions that the last decade saw.</p>
<p>“Before a shot is even fired, we can bolster a diplomatic argument, 
support a friend or deter an enemy,” Mullen said. “We can assist rapidly
 in disaster-relief efforts, as we did in the aftermath of Haiti’s 
earthquake.”</p></blockquote>

 to the  challenges of civilian protection in situations of armed 
conflict,  specifically in the context of air warfare. Against the 
backdrop of the  recent release of the HPCR Manual on International Law 
Applicable to Air  and Missile Warfare, the seminar will address the 
following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What  are the primary features, definitions and principles contained
 in the  Manual? How do these relate to the larger framework of 
international  humanitarian law, or the law of armed conflict?</li>
<li>What is the relevance  for the military of the provisions of the 
Manual, which are a  restatement of existing law applicable to air and 
missile warfare?</li>
<li>How  might the Manual contribute to enhanced protection of civilians during  conflict?</li>

<p><span class="drop_cap">E</span>xcept during take-off and landing, 
military drones are not controlled from their bases in Afghanistan, but 
by pilots in the United States. Yet, there is a growing belief that 
these pilots face combat stress like their comrades in the warzone. Last
 week, Spiegel <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,682852,00.html">posted an online interview</a> with robotic war expert P.W. Singer in which he discussed (among other things) the stress of drone wars.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SPIEGEL ONLINE: One drone pilot told SPIEGEL ONLINE that they suffer from just as much stress and trauma.</strong></p>
<p>Singer: Yes, all this doesn’t mean we’re not seeing all sorts of new 
stressers. In the beginning we feared that drones may make the operators
 not really care about what they’re doing. But the opposite has turned 
out to be true. They may almost care too much. We’re seeing higher 
levels of combat stress among remote units than among some units in 
Afghanistan. We found significantly increased fatigue, emotional 
exhaustion and burnout. Drone operators are more likely to suffer 
impaired domestic relationships, too.</p>
<p><strong>SPIEGEL ONLINE: What explains this stress?</strong></p>
<p>Singer: There are different theories as to why. Traditional bomber 
pilots don’t see their targets. A remote operator sees the target up 
close, he sees what happens to it during the explosion and the 
aftermath. You’re further away physically but you see more. Also, the 
drone war takes place 24/7, 365 days a year. The war doesn’t stop on 
Christmas. It’s like being a fireman when there’s a fire every single 
day, day after day after day. That’s emotionally and physically taxing. 
On top of that, many units are understaffed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Singer does not mention another likely cause of the stress, the so-called “<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26078087/">whiplash transition</a>“.
 Many suspect that the very ability of these drone pilots to live at 
home with their families and “commute” to the warzone everyday is taking
 its toll on the mental health of the pilots. Drone pilots could conduct
 a deadly airstrike in Northern Afghanistan, and attend their kids 
soccer game an hour later. This stress (as Singer points out) is likely 
heightened by the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26078087/">high-def nature of drone warfare</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a fighter jet, “when you come in at 500-600 mph, drop a
 500-pound bomb and then fly away, you don’t see what happens,” said 
Col. Albert K. Aimar, who is commander of the 163rd Reconnaissance Wing 
here and has a bachelor’s degree in psychology. But when a Predator 
fires a missile, “you watch it all the way to impact, and I mean it’s 
very vivid, it’s right there and personal. So it does stay in people’s 
minds for a long time.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, despite all the talk about drone pilot stress, I find it 
unlikely the stress is at levels comparable to those physically present 
in the warzone. I suspect the latter is more akin to the stress problems
 of police and firemen than servicemen on long-term deployment.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">D</span>octors in Fallujah have reported a rise in birth defects. In 2004, the city was the location of brutal urban combat between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Fallujah">insurgents and US Marines</a>. Now, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8548707.stm">doctors are saying that they are seeing an increased incidence of some birth defects</a>. One researcher claims that heart defects have risen to rates 13 times higher than Europe:</p>
<blockquote><p>British-based Iraqi researcher Malik Hamdan told the 
BBC’s World Today programme that doctors in Fallujah were witnessing a 
“massive unprecedented number” of heart defects, and an increase in the 
number of nervous system defects.</p>
<p>She said that one doctor in the city had compared data about birth 
defects from before 2003 – when she saw about one case every two months –
 with the situation now, when, she saw cases every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time US military operations (or, more 
specifically, US weaponry) has been blamed for post-conflict health 
conditions. However, in this case there has been no published study 
confirming the Fallujah observations. I doubt we will have long to wait.</p>

who assisted us in the hospital compound brought not only skill but also
 a “can do” attitude and energy to a medical staff that was stretched to
 its physical and emotional limits. We saw consistent professionalism, 
competence, and compassion in the American soldiers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, the military was a knight-in-shining-armor for beleaguered 
aid workers. While not perfect, the military did an heroic job 
supporting civilian relief efforts. It is good to see NGOs accept the 
military as an important partner in disaster relief operations. Slowly 
humanitarians are seeing the military as a potential ally rather than an
 organizational leper. Now, let us hope the military’s old guard can 
reciprocate by seeing aid workers as more than naive amateurs.</p>

will augment an ongoing C-130 airlift relief operation led by Chile’s

<p>The C-130 Hercules can carry up to 42,000 pounds and use its

<p>The two aircraft departed Muñiz Air National Guard Base, Puerto Rico

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he Department of Defense is releasing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0Bz0nQqmETa6YZGZkOWMwOTAtMTVlZC00OTZlLTkxZTUtNDI2NmZmZDVhZGQx&amp;hl=en">new handbook [pdf]</a>,
 but inside you will not learn how to transport a tank, plan an ambush, 
or jump out of a C-130. Instead, this publication is “a primer for the 
military about private, voluntary, and nongovernmental organizations 
operating in humanitarian emergencies globally”. In other words, 
“humanitarians 101”. </p>
<p>The guide is meant to help familiarize servicemen on the in’s and 
out’s of NGOs, in turn promoting amicable relations between the two, 
which have traditionally varied between mild curiosity to outright 
hostility. The guide’s eighteen chapters cover the gambit of NGO topics 
from “What is an NGO?”, to non-profit bureaucracy, to humanitarian 
logistics, to international NGO coordination, to physical security. 
Overall, the primer offers a fair and largely positive assessment of 
NGOs and their capabilities, portraying them as nimble, creative if 
underfunded groups and the “the driving force in deploying humanitarian 
assistance programs”. Where NGOs stumble says the primer, is logistics 
and large-scale operations. The most NGOs lack the capacity to manage 
large, international movement of goods and equipment. Limited resources 
force NGOs to use off the shelf transportation solutions, cheaper but 
often unreliable in emergencies. Second, the limited resources of NGOs 
prohibit most from running country-size programs. While there are 
coordinating bodies, the fragmented nature of the greater humanitarian 
community means that “[no] matter how much coordination occurs, NGOs are
 still individual entities, often both small and private, that act 
independently during emergencies”, preventing unified, cohesive action.</p>
<p>The primer offers lengthy discussions of ‘typical’ NGO personnel. To 
its credit, it counters the long held stereotype of aid workers as 
unprofessional do-gooders, observing that “[t]he days of witnessing 
untrained and young ‘humanitarians’ attempting to get involved are not 
over, but now more than ever value is placed on professional operations,
 experience, protocol, training, and capacity to handle extremely 
technical tasks in difficult working environments. Advanced degrees and 
program specialties are major rank indicators and most NGOs found 
operating in humanitarian emergencies can be trusted to meet their 
objectives”. NGO personnel are portrayed as professional, experienced 
and independent. They are free agents operating in a loose 
organizational structure, “often tasked with responding to the needs of 
NGO beneficiaries before that of the NGO”. Yet, while highlighting the 
independent nature of humanitarians, the guide cannot resist offering a 
laughable guide to the aid worker ‘uniform’:</p>
<blockquote><p>“That is, there is no easy way to identify NGO personnel.
 Instead, and to generalize grossly, many NGO personnel wear what has 
become seemingly if informally standard — multi pocketed vest (normally 
tan or black), khaki pants, chukka boots, and sometimes a badge with an 
ID card or insignia. Medical personnel often wear or tote fanny-packs 
filled with essential tools or medicines, and engineers and logisticians
 often carry small tool belts.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Where the guide does falters is in local NGO personnel. Local aid 
workers are only briefly discussed, yet play a major and growing role in
 NGO operations. Locals are often hired for their ability to move and 
operate amongst the population (i.e. no fanny-packs). Thus, in many 
cases they will be the primary points of contact in the field.</p>
<p>The last chapter contains the primer’s core message: that there are 
areas of potential, value-added cooperation between humanitarians and 
the militaries. Specifically, the military can support NGO operations by
 offering physical security, logistical capacity, and communications. In
 those three areas the military’s capacity dwarf those in the NGO 
sector. The primer also explains NGOs reluctance to work with the 
military, highlighting the value of the USAID OFDA as a civilian 
middleman between the two sides. NGOs are not going anywhere. The number
 of humanitarian groups has skyrocketed since World War II. In the 
foreseeable future, the military is going to have to work closer with 
NGOs, whether during combat operations in Central Asia or disaster 
relief in the Caribbean. This new primer is both an acknowledgment that 
NGOs cannot be ignored and an argument for greater cooperation.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">S</span>ave the Children’s Patrick Watt recently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8546401.stm">argued that combining humanitarian and security domains risks the safety of humanitarians</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If aid is to be effective it must be planned and carried out in close and trusted consultation with affected communities,</p>
<p>It is clear that soldiers involved in the conflict in Afghanistan 
should not be carrying out sensitive and complex humanitarian work with 
vulnerable communities.</p>
<p>It is only through impartial aid organisations, such as Save the 
Children, that essential rebuilding can be done safely and 
successfully.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Watt is making an impossible argument here. There are real 
benefits to be gained from partnering with the military, but let us put 
that aside. Strictly from a political prospective, it is inappropriate 
to expect governments to isolate development spending from strategic 
considerations while waging a war. If integrating civilian development 
efforts with the military prevents even a handful of combat casualties, 
the risks would be well worth it in the eyes of governments.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span>fter the earthquakes in Haiti and now Chile, I cannot help but be reminded of an old idea once posited by my good friend <a href="http://nextnavy.com/">Craig Hooper</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/04/opinion/04iht-edhooper.html?_r=2">back in 2005</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“An underlying problem is strategic. America simply lacks
 a presence in shallow intertidal zones. Had fast-moving assets been 
nearby, the Bush administration, by getting firsthand information from 
the disaster zone, would have better understood the scope of the tragedy
 and avoided making an embarrassingly low initial aid offer of $15 
million.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Auxiliaries may not capture the imagination. But imagine if 24 
American-flagged ships had, within hours of the tsunami, swarmed into 
the shattered regions of the Indian coast, disgorging helicopters, 
mobile hospitals and recovery specialists. That’s an exciting enough 
vision for even Rumsfeld to embrace.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is an idea that might be worth reconsidering.</p>

 who on February 2nd included “mass killing or genocide” in 
congressional testimony on national security threats. The authors argue 
that Blair’s comments suggest that the security community is finally 
accepting genocide as more than just a humanitarian tragedy:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Genocide’s negative consequences for the United States 
are increasingly plain. Mass violence destabilizes countries and entire 
regions, threatening to spread trafficking in drugs, arms, and persons, 
as well as infectious disease pandemics and youth radicalization. When 
prevention fails, the United States invariably foots much of the bill 
for post-atrocity relief and peacekeeping operations — to the tune of 
billions of dollars. And even as Washington is paying, America’s soft 
power is depleted when the world’s only superpower stands idle while 
innocents are systematically slaughtered.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">C</span>ivilian casualties in Afghanistan is a
 hot topic these days. After years of civilian airstrike deaths hurting 
Afghan public opinion of NATO and its forces, commanders have reined in 
their use. Killing civilians is particularly damaging in NATO’s new 
strategy, specifically focused on winning over the trust of the 
population. To prove the point, earlier this week International Security
 Assistance Force (ISAF) Commander Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal made a <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2010/0223/Afghanistan-war-As-civilian-deaths-rise-NATO-says-Sorry.">public apology for the killing of 27 civilians</a> during a US airstrike.</p>
<p>Previously on Conflict Health, I discussed a 2008 Madelyn Hsiao-Rei 
Hicks and Michael Spagat article proposing the brilliantly named “<a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050243">Dirty War Index</a>”
 as a quantitative means of measuring “particularly undesirable or 
prohibited, i.e., ‘dirty,’ outcomes inflicted on populations during war 
(e.g., civilian death, child injury, or torture)”.  The Dirty War Index 
is calculated as follows: (“Dirty” Events / Total Events)*100. It is a 
quick and umm… dirty measurement of a conflict’s impact on 
non-combatants. Friend of the site Drew Conway, <a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=283">has discussed DWI at length</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that since October 2009 a derivative of the Dirty War 
Index is reportedly being used by NATO to measure operations in Southern
 Afghanistan. The less brilliantly titled “Civilian Battle Damage 
Assessment Ratio (CBDAR)” is</p>
<blockquote><p>“…a method for assessing and tracking proportional 
patterns of civilian casualties from combat. CBDARs can be applied by 
both military forces and humanitarian organisations towards the common 
goal of minimising the civilian impact of conflict. These ratios 
complement absolute numbers on casualties, are easily integrated into 
existing assessment systems, and can track proportions of civilians, 
women, or children among casualties. The ratios can be used for 
monitoring, and to make comparisons between time periods, geographic 
areas, combatant forces, and between weapons, tactics or rules of 
engagement”.</p></blockquote>
<p>The developers of CBDAR have a new article in the British Army Review
 discussing the method. The journal is normally closed to the public, 
but because the authors are awesome (and Conflict Health readers), they 
convinced the-powers-that-be to allow the article to be available for 
download. You can do so <a href="http://personal.rhul.ac.uk/uhte/014/2009%20British%20Army%20Review%20CBDAR.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">S</span>oft power supporters stand between two
 ideological poles. On one hand, humanitarians complain that military 
involvement in the development sector will taint their work. On the 
other hand, hard power evangelists complain that incorporating soft 
power strategies will reduce their warfighting capability to slightly 
above that of the Peace Corps. Craig Kiebler is one of a few people able
 to exist, even thrive, between the two sides. In a post worthy of note,
 Kiebler <a href="http://vethnography.org/2010/01/11/can-services-security-part-1/">argues for service delivery as a critical compliment to physical security</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The foundation of social services sets the stage for 
market and economic sector development, support to individual 
livelihoods, public health, and food security, which in the end, 
supports the efforts of units trying to provide physical security.  
Services become forms of ’soft infrastructure’, if you will, by 
investing in the human capital in a region.  They are not independent of
 physical security, nor is physical security effective without services.
  Therefore, can we devise methodologies to plan and implement security 
functions in conflict areas with more of a holistic approach?”</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Today’s guest post is by <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/Pubs/people.cfm?authorID=692">Paul Rexton Kan</a> of the U.S. Army War College. Kan recently published a book on drug trade and use in modern warfare. The book was <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/book-review-drugs-and-contemporary-warfare/">previously reviewed</a> on Conflict Health and can be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Contemporary-Warfare-Paul-Rexton/dp/1597972576/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266835484&amp;sr=8-1">purchased on Amazon</a>.</em></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span> carton of menthols can be just a 
deadly as a clip of ammo.  The well-known associated health risks of 
smoking are not what make cigarettes deadly in war zones.  Smoking may 
shorten one’s life, but that calculation is lost on a combatant who 
lives in the daily crosshairs of possible death.  Beyond providing 
combatants a simple rush of nicotine, cigarettes play a critical role in
 prolonging many of today’s ongoing and persistent conflicts.</p>
<p>Second only to the trafficking in illegal narcotics, the smuggling of
 cigarettes—both legitimate and counterfeit—fund a variety of groups 
involved in terrorism, insurgency, civil wars and interstate 
conflicts.&nbsp; Because cigarettes are small and light weight, they are
 easy to smuggle into a variety of conflict zones.&nbsp; Plus, the 
disparity in their taxation across the globe has created a rich 
environment for smuggling.&nbsp; The World Health Organization estimates
 that over 10 percent of the 5.7 trillion cigarettes sold globally each 
year are illicit.&nbsp; This means that the global black market alone 
would supply 4.5 packs annually to each person on the planet.</p>
<p>Cigarettes and modern war have an intimate connection.&nbsp; In fact,
 the mass production of cigarettes coincided with the mass mobilization 
of the Great War.&nbsp; Bull Durham tobacco company wanted American GIs 
to smoke their way to victory: “when our boys light up, the Huns will 
light out!”&nbsp; Mass production of cigarettes in a time when heavy, 
conventional forces faced each other across a defined battle space has 
given way to mass smuggling by groups who operate in the shadows of the 
legitimate economy to fund violence across the spectrum of conflict.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, smuggling lives up to Bull Durham’s World War I 
marketing slogan—cigarettes are an expression of patriotism.&nbsp; Those
 who raise money for many of today’s violent conflicts through the 
smuggling of contraband are seen as heroes by those who support the 
movement.&nbsp; In fact, when the conflicts are over and the 
international community seeks to build a stable and sustainable 
government, smugglers often become members of the new government because
 they are already popular among the people they served in the war.</p>
<p>There are very few pressures or disincentives for today’s 
belligerents to give up smuggling cigarettes.&nbsp; Their availability, 
demand, transportability, and the way in which their profits can be 
turned into patriotism and political power means that warring groups are
 just as hooked on cigarettes as smokers themselves.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n the 14th century, Caffa was a 
bustling trading city. By virtue of its location on the Crimean 
Peninsula, the city was a major center for commerce between the 
Mediterranean and Asia. Inside her walls lived and worked a worldly 
population of merchants, traders, and sailors. In 1343 and again in 
1346, the Mongol leader Janibeg besieged Caffa, the first siege was 
ended by a timely intervention of an Italian army, the second by an 
epidemic of plague that swept through the Mongol ranks. In the latter 
stages of the second siege, a widely read and cited account by Genoese 
Gabriele de’ Mussi claims the Mongols catapulted diseased corpses over 
the city walls, classic biological warfare. As the attack spread plague 
through the port city, de’ Mussi observes that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…among those who escaped from Caffa by boat were a few 
sailors who had been infected with the poisonous disease. Some boats 
were bound for Genoa, others went to Venice and to other Christian 
areas. When the sailors reached these places and mixed with the people 
there, it was as if they had brought evil spirits with them: every city,
 every settlement, every place was poisoned by the contagious 
pestilence, and their inhabitants, both men and women, died suddenly” 
(Translation from Horrox 1996, cited in Wheelis 2002).</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on this account, many have credited the 1946 siege of Caffa for
 introducing the black plague to Europe. In this theory, the use of 
biological warfare in the siege indirectly spread the plague by 
infecting refugees. The theory’s implications for modern society is easy
 enough to grasp: the tactical use of biological warfare by a desperate 
commander triggered the greatest epidemic in European history. 
Undoubtably, the implied warning increases the theory’s appeal in 
certain circles,  especially during the Cold War when the world’s 
superpowers actively researched biological weapons and trained to use 
them. However, in a 2002 article Mark Wheelis counters the accuracy of 
the theory. He argues “it is unlikely that the attack had a decisive 
role in the spread of plague to Europe. Much maritime commerce probably 
continued throughout this period, from other Crimean ports. … Thus, 
refugees from Caffa would most likely have constituted only one of 
several streams of infected ships and caravans leaving the region”.  To 
Wheelis, the theory that Caffa played any special role in spreading the 
disease requires an assumption that trade in other forms and from other 
ports was nonexistent. Of course, this was not true. Trade occurred all 
along the frontier between Europe and Asia, and the bubonic plague had a
 multitude of avenues to reach Europe both overland and oversea. Still, 
whether fact or fiction, the original theory has a core insight: the 
impacts of tactical WMD use, whether by foe or friend, will extend 
beyond the battle and the battlefield, to incorporate the whole state, 
region, or globe.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">J</span>ust a heads up, <a href="http://polisci.la.psu.edu/facultybios/Iqbal.html">Zaryab Iqbal</a>, an assistant professor at Penn State, has a new book out on the health consequences and armed conflict, descriptively titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804758816?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=warandhea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0804758816">War and the Health of Nations</a><img src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/ir.gif" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" border="0" height="1" width="1">.
 Personally, I am pretty damn excited about it. I have not got my hands 
on the book yet, but when I do I will post a review on Conflict Health. 
Until then, you will have to be satisfied with the publisher’s 
description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assessments of the costs of war generally focus on the 
financial, political, military, and territorial risks associated with 
involvement in violent conflict. Often overlooked are the human costs of
 war, particularly their effects on population well-being. In War and 
the Health of Nations, Zaryab Iqbal explores these human costs by 
offering the first large-scale empirical study of the relationship 
between armed conflict and population health. Working within the 
influential “human security” paradigm—which emphasizes the security of 
populations rather than states as the central object of global 
security—Iqbal analyzes the direct and indirect mechanisms through which
 violent conflict degrades population health. In addition to battlefield
 casualties, these include war’s detrimental economic effects, its role 
in the creation of refugees and forced migration, and the destruction of
 societies’ infrastructure. In doing so, she provides a comprehensive 
picture of the processes through which war and violent conflict affect 
public health and the well-being of societies in a cross-national 
context.</p>
<p>War and the Health of Nations provides a conceptual and theoretical 
framework for understanding the influence of violent interstate and 
intrastate conflict on the quality of life of populations and 
empirically analyzes the war-and-health relationship through statistical
 models using a universal sample of states. The analyses provide strong 
evidence for the direct as well as the indirect effects of war on public
 health and offer important insights into key socio-economic 
determinants of health achievement. The book thus demonstrates the 
significance of population health as an important consequence of armed 
conflict and highlights the role of societal vulnerabilities in studies 
of global security.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>ver the last few weeks, USNS Comfort has been part of the Haiti zeitgeist, both in America and overseas. The ship appears in <a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=USNS+Comfort">hundreds of stories, articles, videos, and blog posts</a>.
 Her white hull has become a symbol of United States humanitarianism in 
Haiti. However, the converted oil tanker’s original primary purpose was 
to support combat operations, not conduct the humanitarian assistance 
and disaster relief missions that gained her renown. So I ask the 
readers, if you were to design the next generation of hospital ship, the
 next USNS Comfort, what would the vessel look like? Here are some of my
 own thoughts.</p>
<h3>Small, Fast, And Shallow</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned on the USNI blog, USNS Comfort arrived off the coast of Haiti slightly over <a href="http://blog.usni.org/2010/01/18/88-hours-and-7-minutes/">88 hours after the earthquake</a>.
 In that time, the converted oil tanker, manned by only a skeleton crew,
 was stocked with supplies, staffed with medical personnel from multiple
 services and NGOs, and sailed down the Atlantic coast. In getting the 
massive ship from a pier in New England to a disaster zone in the 
Caribbean, the crew proved themselves to be true professionals. 
Impressive is not strong enough a word to describe their accomplishment,
 it was Herculean. And, that is the problem.</p>
<p>To maximize effectiveness, rapid arrival on station after a disaster 
should occur because of the ship’s design, not in spite of it. Hospital 
ships must be small, fast, and shallow. They must operate in areas with 
small, damaged, or no ports. They must navigate waterways littered with 
debris without assistance and anchor in the shallow waters close to 
shore. Most importantly, hospital ships must be fast. Arriving in the 
first 24 hours is orders of magnitude more helpful than arriving in the 
first 48 hours, or 88.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Medical Team</h3>
<p>Instead of staffing hospital ships with an ad hoc complement of 
riders, hospital ships deserve dedicated medical contingents. Dedicated 
medical teams would reduce deployment time and improve mission 
effectiveness. I am not discounting the importance of NGOs such as 
Project Hope, but rather suggesting that NGO health professionals should
 supplement a core medical team that has trained and worked with each 
other and with the ship. Many will say the armed forces do not have 
enough medical personnel. They are right, but that does mean we should 
not do it. Rather, it only means we must train more personnel.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, Melissa Batchelor Warnke, an organizer for the Save Darfur Coalition, commented on a new study on the region in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/opinion/lweb01darfur.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimesopinion">a letter to the New York Times</a>.
 The study estimated that disease caused 80% of the deaths in Darfur. It
 is an unremarkable finding. Disease is most often the primary killer in
 conflict. And, as far as I know, nobody has claimed Darfur is the 
exception to the rule. Warnke’s letter attempted to preempt those that 
would argue the study weakens claims that genocide is taking place in 
Darfur. Warnke points out that “deaths by indirect means — starvation, 
diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria and infection — are as much a product of 
the campaign of destruction as direct physical violence”. In other 
words, the natural world can be a weapon of genocide.</p>
<p>This strategy is hardly new and appears in a number of variations. Take an example highlighted in Hugo Slim’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Civilians-Madness-Morality-Columbia/dp/0231700369">Killing Civilians</a>:
 In 1904, the German colony of South West Africa experienced a revolt by
 the local Herero tribe. After the German Governor failed to put down 
the rebellion, the Kaiser sent General Lothar von Trotha to the 
territory with orders to crush the Herero tribe. The General’s strategy 
was both eloquent in its simplicity and total in its brutality.  
Outmaneuvering the rebels, he encircled them except for a small gap in 
the lines facing Omaheke sandveld. Left with little choice, the Herero 
people fled into the desert. Next, Trotha’s forces sealed all waterholes
 around the sandveld and blocked any escape from the desert with 250km 
of fences, guard posts, and patrols. The Herero tribe was trapped in the
 unforgiving sandveld with no means of survival or escape. Eventually, 
Trotha would order his forces on the border of the sandveld to kill all 
Herero on sight. Thomas Pakenham describes the effect of the General’s 
strategy: “German patrols encountered the remnants of the Herero people 
trying to break back west to their land and water, walking skeletons who
 were shot or bayoneted as a matter of course”. The environment was an 
effective weapon, before the 1904 rebellion Hereros numbered 80,000 in 
South West Africa. In 1911, that number was 15,000.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n August, a video was released 
reportedly showing Sri Lankan soldiers executing bound and blindfolded 
Tamils during the last weeks of that country’s long civil war. Last 
month, the U.N. special investigator on extra-judicial killings <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33423">declared that the videos are likely authentic</a> and has called on the Sri Lankan government to conduct its own investigation:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In light of the persistent flow of other allegations of 
extra-judicial executions committed by both sides during the closing 
phases of war against the LTTE, I call for an independent inquiry to be 
established to carry out an impartial investigation into war crimes and 
other grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights 
law allegedly committed in Sri Lanka”</p></blockquote>
<p>The video tape is the latest in a string of allegations of human 
rights abuses by the Sri Lankan military during the end and immediate 
aftermath of the civil war. The most prominent event was the forced 
detainment of thousands of ethnic Tamil civilians in camps, often with 
little food, security or access to health care. Not that the rebels can 
claim the moral high ground either; during the final government 
offensive LTTE herded thousands of civilians into the battleground to 
use as human shields. Still, the allegations have tainted an otherwise 
undisputed victory against the Tamil rebel group. Given the scope of the
 alleged abuses, history might well remember the brutal means used by 
both sides in the war more than the end result.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>oday, the Department of Defense’s Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) <a href="http://steeljawscribe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/25982780-Unclassified-Fouo.pdf">was released online</a>.
 The QDR details the future thinking and direction of the US military 
for the next four years. The 2010 release describes itself as “truly a 
wartime QDR”, examining the doctrine of a military involved in two major
 conflicts in Central Asia and smaller operations around the globe. In 
addition to outlining the DoD’s thinking on the combat operations, the 
review highlights two areas relating to humanitarian assistance and 
disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Civil Affairs</h3>
<p>The QDR correctly points out that non-state violent groups flourish 
in regions with ineffective governance. Improving the capacity of 
governments to provide basic services, including health, to populations 
can deny those areas to enemies of the United States. This mission is 
the purview of civil affair units. In recent years, civil affairs have 
been almost entirely manned by reserved personnel. To improve civil 
affairs capacity, the QDR calls for expanding the DoD’s civil affairs 
teams with “the first active duty civil affairs brigade to support 
general purpose forces”. In other words, the DoD is enlarging its soft 
power forces.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Allies</h3>
<p>The review places particular emphasis on the United States’ 
“unmatched capabilities and a willingness on the part of the nation to 
employ them in defense of our interests and the common good”. The 
stewardship role referred to in the QDR is largely operationalized 
through strengthening and supporting US allies, especially in Oceana and
 Asia.</p>
<p>Poignantly given the earthquake in Haiti, humanitarian disasters are 
mentioned as one such area where the US could have a national security 
interest in strengthening weakened governments against natural 
disasters. The DoD envisions achieving this goal mainly through 
assisting foreign militaries: “In some nations, the military is the only
 institution with the capacity to respond to a large-scale natural 
disaster. Proactive engagement with these countries can help build their
 capability to respond to such events”. Comparatively, little space is 
dedicated to working with foreign civilian institutions and NGOs.</p>
<p>The DoD discusses at length partnering with Asia and Oceanic states 
to improve their capacity to respond to humanitarian crises and natural 
disasters. Africa and South America are only briefly mentioned regarding
 the same topic. Clearly the disaster diplomacy that occurred in Asia 
after the tsunami is still part of the DoD’s institutional memory and is
 driving the focus on DoD health diplomacy in Asia as opposed to other 
regions.</p>
<p>Overall, the QDR offers a glimpse of a military shifting increasingly
 towards soft power while still hoping to maintain its traditional hard 
power focus. Whether they can achieve expertise in both will be the 
question of the decade.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">G</span>reetings from Durban, South Africa. 
The most frustrating consequence of moving is disconnecting from the 
global conversation. I admit it, I am a news junkie. My typical reading 
list includes almost a dozen newspapers and hundreds of other sites and 
blogs. For the first week, the only news I can get in my cottage home 
was from the South African Broadcasting Company’s (SABC) morning show. 
Unfortunately, their global news segments just a few minutes, covering a
 maximum of five stories.</p>
<p>Haiti has featured prominently in SABC broadcasts since I started 
watching. That much is appropriate, and expected. But, more striking is 
the impressive exposure the USNS Comfort has had on SABC. Almost 
everyday, the US Navy ship is mentioned and shown working in Haiti. The 
broadcasts include both segments of interviews with the health workers 
onboard, or B-roll of the ship off the coast.</p>
<p>It was with great pleasure and pride that I watched SABC show clip 
after clip of US servicemen in Haiti and US Navy ships off her coast. 
Keep up the good work, the world is watching.</p>

<p>On May 14th, 1943, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHS_Centaur">AHS Centaur</a>,
 an Australia hospital ship sailed off the coast of Queensland towards 
Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. The ship had 332 medical personnel and
 crew on board. She was marked with large red crosses and sailed without
 military escort as per the Geneva Convention requirements. The vessel 
would not survive to see dawn. The Japanese submarine I-177, commanded 
by Hajime Nakagawa, torpedoed AHS Centaur in an early morning attack, 
taking 268 lives. Now, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=9383477">the discovery of her wreck on December 20th</a> has resurfaced the sensitive issue between Australia and Japan.
</p>
<p>The sinking of AHS Centaur violated international war law and is 
considered one of Australia’s worst wartime tragedies. Her demise turned
 the vessel into a martyr for Australians, confirming the brutality of 
the Japanese in the public’s mind. General Douglas MacArthur claimed the
 attack showed the “limitless savagery” of the Japanese. The Australian 
government used the sinking to enrage public opinion and rally 
Australians in support for the war effort.</p>
<p>I-177′s captain was never tried for the sinking, but was convicted on
 other war crimes by the Allies. The attack has long been a sore subject
 for the Japanese, who only acknowledged in 1979 that I-177 did indeed 
sink the hospital ship, after denying involvement since 1943. 
Furthermore, Tokyo claims it never ordered the attack, a fact if false 
would likely lead to Australian pressure for additional war crime 
charges. In a statement on the search for AHS Centaur, Japan said it  
“made the greatest efforts for world peace and prosperity as a 
responsible member of the international community and has also developed
 a close relationship with Australia.” To their credit, the Centaur 
Association, the RSL, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
have all made statements that Japan does not need to apology for the 
sinking of AHS Centaur. Apparently 66 years of good relations is enough 
time for some countries to let history be history.</p>

Albon</a></span> on <abbr class="published" title="2009-12-28">December 28, 2009</abbr><span class="edit_post pad_left">[<a class="post-edit-link" href="http://conflicthealth.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1320&amp;action=edit" title="Edit Post">edit</a>]</span></p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>or decades demographers and 
epidemiologists have observed a peculiar phenomenon during and after 
war. In these times, the ratio of male to female newborns shifts ever so
 slightly towards the former. In other words:  more boys are born during
 and soon after wars. The change is slight, MacMahon and Pugh’s 1954 
study finds one sex ratio shifted from 51.406 to 51.481 after WWII.</p>
<p>A number of theories explaining this ‘returning shoulder effect’ have
 been posited. One in particular has potential broader application in 
conflict research. Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics 
and Politics argues that the phenomenon is a “byproduct of the fact that
 taller soldiers are more likely to survive battle and that taller 
parents are more likely to have sons”.</p>
<p>Kanazawa tests his theory by examining the height of a non-random 
sample of British enlisted men serving in WWI. More specifically, 
Kanazawa draws his sample from only one of the 23,608 reels of 
microfiche at the UK National Archives. Since the reels are organized by
 last name, his sample contains only soldiers with the names Ababreltom 
to Ablett. Methodological problems of a non-random sample aside, the 
author finds supportive results: “The surviving soldiers in my sample 
have a significantly higher mean height than fallen soldiers”. Since 
height is positively related to the probability of having a son, war 
would have a positive relationship on the number of male births after 
intense conflict.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="frame" src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/height-survive.png" alt="height-survive.png" border="0" height="317" width="318"></div>
<p>While Kanazawa resists providing a theory on why taller soldiers are 
more likely to survive warfare, he does offer some possibilities. First,
 taller and larger soldiers are more resilient to disease and wounding. 
Second, since height is related to intelligence, taller soldiers would 
be more likely to rise in the ranks and avoid the most dangerous duties.
 Third, and my personal favorite:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dominic D. P. Johnson suggests another interesting 
hypothesis. If vital organs in the body do not increase in size linearly
 with the body size (height and weight), then it means that taller and 
heavier soldiers, while they may be more likely to be shot because of 
their larger body size, have nonetheless more room in their body where 
they can be ‘safely’ shot and still survive the injury.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond explaining the returning soldier effect, the article is a 
reminder that even among similarly aged enlisted soldiers, war does not 
try men equally. Armies are not unitary objects, but organizations of 
individuals facing individualized risk. The same argument can be applied
 to civilian populations. Warfare’s effect and risk is unique to the 
person. Populations face war as individuals.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://eduardoleoni.com/">Eduardo Leoni</a> points out that a data scientist I respect very much has <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/research/published/kanazawa.pdf">serious questions about Kanazawa’s statistics</a> in this and similar papers.</p>

<p>Below is a list of stories I enjoyed but did not have time to write about. Happy holidays everyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.informationdissemination.net/2009/12/connectivity-is-soft-power.html">Connectivity is Soft Power</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I was once asked what I would use a single airship in a 
massive natural disaster response scenario. The question was actually 
more specific, it was how I would use a single airship responding from 
Bahrain to Karachi, Pakistan in a humanitarian support operation 
following a massive natural disaster with an airship that could move at 
100 mph to prepare the way for naval forces responding from the sea.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://securitycrank.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/winning-the-war-30-taliban-at-a-time/">Winning the War, 30 Taliban at a Time</a></p>
<blockquote><p>But the much more important point remains: how could we 
possibly have any idea how the war is going, here or anywhere else, when
 the bad guys seem only to die in groups of 30? The sheer ubiquity of 
that number in fatality and casualty counts is astounding, to the point 
where I don’t even pay attention to a story anymore when they use that 
magic number 30. It is an indicator either of ignorance or deliberate 
spin… but no matter the case, whenever you see the number 30 used in 
reference to the Taliban, you should probably close the tab and move 
onto something else, because you just won’t get a good sense of what 
happened there.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://vethno.com/2009/11/21/musings-conflict-disease/">H1N1: Musings on Conflict and Disease Transmission</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Malnutrition has always been a major risk factor for 
disease transmission, allowing diseases that would normally be 
considered of minor public health importance to take a foothold in a 
population and become major issues.  Lack of food security also 
contributes to the consumption of poorer quality food, increasing the 
potential for outbreaks of foodborne illness in an already compromised 
group.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.theworld.org/2009/12/17/international-medical-corps-a-thousand-words/">International Medical Corps: A Thousand Words</a></p>
<blockquote><p>For 25 years, International Medical Corps has been 
training doctors and providing medical care in some of the world’s most 
troubled places. From Angola and Bosnia, to Afghanistan and Somalia, 
International Medical Corps staff have been working with locals to 
mitigate the effects of things like war, natural disaster, and 
malnutrition. Along the way, the group has collected photos from the 
field. Now, those photos have been published in a new book called A 
Thousand Words. International Medical Corps President and CEO Nancy 
Aossey recently sat down with The World to talk about some of her 
favorite photos from the book.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n May, the Sri Lankan government won a crushing victory over LTTE rebels in the northern reaches of the island country. Now, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/12/2009121431340755939.html">a Sri Lankan Army General is accusing the Defense Minister of ordering the killing of surrendering LTTE leaders</a>.
 General Sarath Fonseka was in charge of Sri Lanka’s military during the
 last offensive of the war. Now, he is challenging the sitting president
 in the upcoming elections and accusing Defense Minister Gotabhaya 
Rajapakse, the President’s brother, of ordering the Army to take no 
prisoners during the last days of the war. Rajabhaya denies the 
accusation. Fonseka claims he was in China when the Defense Minister 
gave the orders, only learning about them later from an unnamed 
journalist.</p>
<p>Did the Sri Lankan military kill surrendering LTTE? Probably, but 
likely not on orders. The moment of surrender is one of the most 
dangerous times for a soldier. Both the captor and captive are 
vulnerable to active deceit or adrenaline brutality. Is the surrender a 
trap? Will the captors seek revenge? Furthermore, the act of 
surrendering is the only commonplace battlefield activity left out from 
most military educations. When considering how best to surrender, every 
soldier has to reinvents the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">C</span>hange.org’s <a href="http://war.change.org/">War and Peace</a> blog has been <a href="http://war.change.org/blog/view/debate_should_us_civilian_aid_and_military_operations_be_conducted_together_or_separately">posting</a> a <a href="http://war.change.org/blog/view/militarization_of_aid_vs_humanitarian_neutrality_in_afghanistan_part_i">series</a>
 on the militarization of humanitarianism in Afghanistan. It is a good 
series and I recommend you read it. Today’s article is from Una Vera, a 
good friend in the development community. Let’s hope what I am about to 
say doesn’t change that, because I disagree with her wholeheartedly. <a href="http://war.change.org/blog/view/militarization_of_aid_vs_humanitarian_neutrality_in_afghanistan_part_i">Una writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s flat out wrong for USAID to attach counterinsurgency
 strings to aid funds. Period. If organizations like the IRC and Oxfam 
don’t want to do post-battle reconstruction and development work, they 
should not be expected to, and they should be eligible for USAID funding
 anyway. Most of the major humanitarian NGOs working in Afghanistan are 
working in dozens of other countries, and their leadership must consider
 how civil-military relations in Afghanistan could affect relief and 
development efforts elsewhere in the world. For an organization like 
CARE, working closely with the US military in Afghanistan –especially in
 areas where where coalition forces have caused civilian casualties– 
could imperil vital projects in other conflict zones.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have heard this argument before, and both then and now I am left 
scratching my head. The United States is, for better or worse, at war. I
 wish we weren’t at war, but I am only given a single vote in deciding 
such matters, and I was outvoted. <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/">USAID</a> and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">DoD</a>
 are both institutions of the United States government. When American 
servicemen are giving their lives to win a war, how could it be “flat 
out wrong” for USAID to use its budget to help them win? It is 
impossible to expect USAID to remain neutral while soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, and marines fight.</p>
<p>Unlike USAID, NGOs are independent actors. They can have as much or 
as little interaction with the US military as they wish. But, they 
cannot accept US government funds and then not expect some strings 
attached. Well, <em>they can</em>, but the United States has the right 
to give the money to someone else. Is what the US government doing 
humanitarianism? Absolutely not. It is a military and political 
strategy. If cooperating with that strategy furthers an NGO’s own 
normative goals, they should take USAID funding. If not, they should 
look for money elsewhere.</p>
<p>I wish the US government was an absolute humanitarian and altruistic 
force in the world. But, it isn’t. The United States is a country 
working maximize the self-interest of its own citizens. Sometimes those 
of us with normative goals can use this self-interest to help some 
people (e.g. promoting hospital-ships instead of warships). Sometimes we
 can’t. But, what we can never do is expect the United States to act 
with solely humanitarian motives.</p>
<p>There are international organizations working for all: the United 
Nations and ICRC to name just two. I believe in these organizations. I 
love these organizations. Their work and ideals are the best of 
humanity. But, USAID is not one of these organizations, and it is 
unreasonable to expect them to act like one, especially in war.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n January 20th, I am moving to Durban,
 South Africa for a year. Durban will be my base from which to conduct 
field research around Southern Africa relating to my dissertation. 
During that time, my wife is taking a year off from medical school to 
complete a masters program in development at the University of 
KwaZulu-Natal. The move is the culmination of almost two years of 
preparations on our part. We are excited. Southern Africa is my family’s
 homeland and going back fulfills a longtime goal. There will certainly 
be more details to come, but three things are worth noting upfront:</p>
<p>First, I will continue to write Conflict Health in Durban. Writing 
this site is far too enjoyable to stop now. My best ideas have come from
 posts on this site, especially those critiqued by commentors.</p>
<p>Second, in addition to regular posts, I am planning on writing a 
series of posts about my time in Africa. The series will focus primarily
 on the experience of conducting research there. Hopefully it will both 
be useful and entertaining for readers.</p>
<p>Third, if you live in South Africa, are coming out for the World Cup 
(we have quarter-final tickets), or know great people there, please send
 me an email. Having been spoiled by all the interesting people to meet 
in the Bay Area, I would love the opportunity to meet more while in 
South Africa.</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">E</span>arly last week, President Obama put 
forward his Afghanistan endgame. For those few readers living in a hole,
 the new strategy will deploy 30,000-37,000 additional NATO troops to 
the country. The hope is that the influx of ground forces will give the 
Afghan government time to build the legitimacy and capacity needed to 
continue fighting after international forces withdraw, optimistically 
scheduled for 2011. This is a markedly different strategy from the 
previous administration, which readily accepted the possibility of a 
semi-permanent, strong American presence in the country. Does health 
have a place in Obama’s new strategy? Absolutely. Enhancing 
Afghanistan’s local healthcare capacity offers a means to establish the 
political legitimacy of the central government.</p>
<p>Currently, most Afghanis have little relationship with Kabul. Outside
 the capital, the government has little role the lives of citizens, 
providing minimal services or public goods. The dubious reelection of 
Karzai only reinforced the disconnect between the general population and
 the political machinations in Kabul. Obama’s plan is contingent on 
closing this divide, building (note: not rebuilding) Afghanistan’s 
social contract. Increasing the capacity of Afghanistan’s local health 
system would be an important move towards increasing the interaction 
between the population and the Afghan government. In other words, 
hospitals and health clinics are “points of sale” for selling the value 
of the central government. The more citizens percieve interacting with 
the central government as beneficial to their lives and livelihoods, the
 more they will support that government when threatened. Whether Obama’s
 strategy includes such a goal is unclear.</p>
<p>But, I must end with a note of caution. As pointed out eloquently by Maj. Gail Fisher, the concept of <a href="http://mendstate.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-legitimacy.html">political legitimacy might be inappropriate in Afghanistan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ideas of legitimacy are most likely created by cultures 
as shared meanings and understandings about governance and the 
relationship between the government and the individual in that culture. 
So I am looking for an understanding of “legitimacy” of systems outside 
our own Western view. For example, Afghanistan is a clientelistic 
society– what does that mean for governance? What does that mean for the
 health of their people? I doubt that the people of Afghanistan have the
 same understanding and ideation of governance as I and my neighbors. 
Their expectations are different, meaning that development must fit in 
to their schema, rather than mine. Do the people of Afghanistan expect 
the central government to supply a health system? I would suspect they 
do not. We, in America, have the same debate at this very time over the 
lack of coverage of nearly 50 million people and what should be done. 
Most people do not expect the government to provide health care to the 
population. Working with the Minister of Public Health in Afghanistan to
 build the health system is admirable work, but is it legitimizing the 
government? Does it delegitimize the coalition efforts to be involved? 
Should only NGOs do this work? All these questions depend upon the 
cultural ideation of legitimacy and health institutions, I think.</p></blockquote>
<p>Food for thought for sure.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, President Obama announced the deployment of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/world/asia/01orders.html">30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan</a>. The troop surge is part of a <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/the-dutch-approach/">new strategy set forth by General Stanley A. McChrystal</a>.
 The strategy shifts focus from kinetic to non-kinetic operations: 
protecting civilians, development projects, and winnings hearts and 
minds. It will be central to America’s operations in Afghanistan for 
years to come, and even the basis for an American endgame there. Army, 
Marine, and Air Force roles in the McChrystal approach are clear. The 
former two are boots on the ground, while the latter provides 
logistical, intelligence, and combat support. The Navy, however, appears
 to have little place in this new strategy. The Navy’s primary 
contribution so far has been combat air support. But, airstrikes have 
fallen out of favor in Afghanistan as of late due to mounting civilian 
casualties. McChrystal’s new strategy should worry the Navy leadership, 
since Secretary of Defense Gates has demonstrated a strong preference 
for funding programs with applications in current conflicts, and a 
willingness to cut programs failing that criteria (and more importantly:
 to fight legislators’ attempts to block cuts). Does the Navy have a 
place in McChrystal’s war? Yes, but not without some soul-searching.</p>
<p>The Navy can play a significant role in McChrystal’s strategy. Every 
year, thousands of sailors deploy on humanitarian, development, and 
disaster relief operations around the world. Sailors have repaired 
schools in the Pacific, organized health clinics in South America, and 
delivered disaster aid in the Caribbean. These operations are outside 
traditional military education and have required developing a new set of
 skills, notably the ability to plan and work side by side with 
different services, agencies, governments, and NGO partners. The 
missions have given the Navy hard won experience adapting military 
resources to humanitarian, development, and disaster relief challenges. 
This is particularly true of short term, high impact programs, <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/gates-views-of-militarys-role-in-development/">the type of military involvement in development envisioned by Secretary of Defense Gates</a>. The Navy could have precisely the type of soft-power experience McChrystal’s Afghanistan strategy requires.</p>
<p>The main obstacle to a major Navy role in Afghanistan is not 
material, but cultural. The Navy’s leadership is dominated by line 
officers. This perpetuates an institutional culture valuing warships and
 warplanes. However, the enemy has neither fleet or coastline. All the 
carrier strike groups in the world will not find victory in the 
mountains of Afghanistan. To win over the hearts and minds, McChrystal’s
 strategy requires a surge of a new sort: of nurses, doctors, dentists, 
engineers, and civil-affairs units, the domain of the staff corp 
officer. While staff corp officers have a secondary role in the Navy’s 
traditional warfighting focus, they have played a major part in the 
Navy’s humanitarian and development cruises. Staff corp officers might 
not be able to plan a defense of the North Atlantic, but they can run 
health clinics, manage construction projects, and coordinate with NGOs. 
They are America’s soft-power specialists. If the Navy is going to take 
advantage of the humanitarian and development institutional knowledge of
 its staff corp officers, it must overcome its cultural biases towards 
the interests of line officers. In the 1980s, the Soviet Army learned 
that Afghanistan was not the Fulda Gap. Now, the US Navy must accept it 
is not the Taiwan Strait either.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rusi.org/publications/journal/journal/ref:A4AEB15C637534/"><span class="drop_cap">R</span>USI Journal has a new article</a>
 out on the relationship of armed conflict and medicine, rather 
unoriginally titled “war and medicine”. The author is the UK’s Surgeon 
General of the Defense Medical Services Lt. General Louis Lillywhite. In
 the article, Lillywhite addresses a gamut of issues, with emphasis on 
the role of the MoD and Surgeon General. The article is too broad to do 
justice in a single post, but one point deserves attention: Lillywhite’s
 spectrum of post-conflict health systems.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have at one extreme the situation in Western Europe at
 the end of the Second World War, with its preconflict modern health 
service, health personnel in place and a need simply for economic aid 
and infrastructure repair.</p>
<p>In the middle, we have countries such as Iraq where there was in many
 parts a modern health service which had over fifteen years slowly 
deteriorated, and where the need was primarily to modernise. Part of the
 UK contribution to Iraq via the Department of Health was, and is, to 
take clinicians from Iraq to the UK in order to introduce them to modern
 techniques so that they could return to Iraq to raise the overall 
standard of medical care in that country.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, we have countries such as 
Afghanistan where it is not health re-construction that is required, but
 health construction.</p></blockquote>
<p>The natural policy implication of this spectrum, mentioned only in 
passing by Lillywhite, is that different types of post-conflict health 
systems require different health strategies. More interestingly, there 
is likely contrasting costs and benefits based on a system’s position on
 the spectrum. Health systems towards the middle and top of the spectrum
 are easier to reconstruct. The foundation of the health infrastructure 
and institutional knowledge is already present. However, health systems 
at the bottom of the spectrum still have “low hanging fruit” health 
problems. These are diseases and conditions which can be cheaply tackled
 but have significant health benefits to the population. If Gates is 
interested in using development to win hearts and minds in Afghanistan, 
he would be wise to go for the low hanging fruit.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20091207/scahill">Jeremy Scahill of <em>The Nation</em></a>
 claimed Blackwater (Xe) contractors run covert snatch and grab missions
 out of Karachi for the US military. It is a great piece to read over 
turkey leftovers. Scahill’s claims of private black operations in AfPak 
has inspired comment by every pundit with a tangental relationship to 
national security. In addition, the article has triggered a second <a href="http://war.change.org/blog/view/blackwater_assassins_posing_as_aidworkers">firestorm</a>
 in the humanitarian and development communities over allegation that 
Blackwater employees “work undercover as aid workers”. Una Vera, a good 
friend in the aid community, responded to the story this way: “This is 
going to be ruinous. I’m so angry I’m literally at a loss for words 
now”.</p>
<p>Personally, I am amazed either of Scahill’s claims surprised people. 
First, PMC contracting is a common method of working under the radar. 
Granted, the majority of these contracts involve training and not ‘tip 
of the spear’ missions, but still there is little doubt they happen. 
Second, and relevant to this site, who else is an undercover team of 
burly westerners going to pose as? Tourists? Exchange students?</p>
<p>The truth is that posing as aid workers is a nothing new. During a daring hostage rescue of FARC hostages, Colombian <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/colombian-hostage-rescue-could-of-been-discovered-by-a-single-internet-search/">special forces dressed up as members of a fake NGO</a>, “Mision Internacional Humanitaria”. Some accounts even claim <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7510423.stm">the special forces wore ICRC armbands</a>, a clear violation of the Geneva Convention. In 2006, <a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2006/2006-02-28-02.asp">Kruma Yaya posed as an Afghani aid worker</a> setting up a computer science training during an attempted suicide assassination of the regional governor. Even journalist <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0609/21/i_ins.01.html">admit posing</a> as aid workers. </p>
<p>This is not to say posing as aid workers is right. The practice has 
real dangers for humanitarians in the field. But, it is not a 
revolutionary tactic, or even a new one.</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, at the National Guard Joint 
Senior Leadership Conference, Defense Secretary Gates was asked about 
the military’s role in development. <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4517">His answer is telling.</a>
 It offers an insider’s view of the military’s vision of itself in 
development. His response will likely be cited by policymakers and 
academics for years to come. Below is Secretary Gate’s answer in its 
entirety, emphasis is mine.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>SEC. GATES:</strong> The Secretary-General of the
 U.N. many years ago, Dag Hammarskjold in referring to peacekeeping 
said, “It’s not a soldier’s job, but often only a soldier can do it.”</p>
<p>I think that there’s a question of sequencing here when we have — and
 it ties in with the capabilities we can bring — when the security 
situation still is not stable enough for civilians to be deployed. It 
seems to me what’s really important as we clear, hold and build that the
 build — that these are not sequential. We have to hold and clear or 
clear and hold, but we need the development assistance. We need money 
like the CERP funds [Commander's Emergency Response Program] in there 
not when security is completely established, but right after we’ve 
cleared.</p>
<p><em>We need people as General Petraeus did in Iraq, as soon as we’ve 
cleared an area literally the next day or the same day, we need somebody
 in there with some money and some capability that begins putting young 
men to work and putting a shovel or a broom in their hands instead of a 
gun.</em> And it seems to me that’s often the situation where the Guard 
and the expertise in the Guard can provide the initial response in areas
 in Afghanistan until the security situation is stabilized enough for 
the civilians to come in.</p>
<p>Now, the truth of the matter is as I’ve said for almost two and a 
half years now, the civilian elements of our government that were expert
 in these areas have been neglected for a very long time. <em>When I 
retired in 1993, the Agency for International Development had about 
16,000 employees. It was an expeditionary agency. Most of those people 
had the kind of expertise in agricultural development, rule of law, 
governance, water systems, irrigation systems and so on. And they 
expected to be deployed to developing countries. They expected to live 
in primitive conditions. And they expected to have situations that were 
occasionally dangerous. And that was part of their career and that was 
part of what they wanted to do with their lives.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>The Agency for International Development now has about 3,000
 employees and it’s mainly a contracting agency. So we’ve lost that 
civilian capacity that played such an important role for us in the 
developing world all through the Cold War.</em> And so I think that 
until, and it is beginning to change under both Secretary Rice and now 
under Secretary Clinton and with the support of two successive 
presidents and the Congress, the State Department is beginning to get 
the kind of funding that is necessary for — to rebuild these 
capabilities. But it’s still a ways in the future and, in my view, there
 has to be a role. <em>There will be a role for us and particularly as 
one of the central themes in the QDR is the development of partnership 
relationships with other partner relationships with other countries so 
that we can help them build their capacity so we don’t have to send 
soldiers in there.</em> Part of that will be helping them with some of 
their development and I think the partner relationships that exist 
between a number of our state Guards and these others countries and I 
will tell you ever time I meet with a minister of defense of a country 
where we have those kinds of relationships, they bring it up with me.</p>
<p><em>So I think that there will be an institutional role for the Guard
 in this arena, but I will tell you I don’t think it’s a function we 
should take over as a long-term significant mission of men and women in 
uniform.</em> <em>I think this is basically a civilian task and we ought to be there to help them.</em>
 We ought to be there when we’re in a situation like Afghanistan where 
the security may not be as strong enough for civilians to go in, to have
 people in there working on agricultural development and so on as the 
first phase so that we aren’t waiting too long to begin showing people 
ways in which their lives can improve on a daily basis.</p>
<p>My own view is we need to be very cautious about some of the big 
projects that people think about for development. That reminds me of the
 way the Soviet Union did business. <em>What we need and what works, in 
my view, is to do things that can be done quickly and that in a small 
village can show people that their lives have actually changed for the 
better by ISAF troops being there. And it can be a well. It can be an 
all-weather road for local farmers. It can be a little bridge. It can be
 a one room schoolhouse. You can do a lot of these small projects within
 the framework of the dollars that we have available. But the most 
important thing about them is that the Afghans see them and the local 
Afghans see their lives getting better because we’re there. The first 
stage of doing that, I think, can be done by our military forces and 
especially by the National Guard, but longer term, that mission has to 
go to the civilian side of the government.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he incredible and brutal end of the 
Sri Lankan civil war last year gave hope for reconciliation between the

That is great in itself, but the true brilliance is that the Guardian 
posts all the data for download. Want to confirm their conclusions about

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>here is a new documentary very likely of interest to Conflict Health readers. <a href="http://www.humanterrainmovie.com/">Human Terrain: War Becomes Academic</a>
 is the story of Human Terrain Teams, social scientists embedded with 
military units in Iraq and Afghanistan. Here is the official synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Human Terrain’ is two stories in one. The first exposes 
the U.S. effort to enlist the best and the brightest of American 
universities in a struggle for the hearts and minds of its enemies. 
Facing long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military adopts a 
controversial new program, ‘Human Terrain Systems’, to make cultural 
awareness a key element of its counterinsurgency strategy. Designed to 
embed social scientists with combat troops, the program swiftly comes 
under attack by academic critics who consider it misguided and unethical
 to gather intelligence and target potential enemies for the military. 
Gaining rare access to wargames in the Mojave Desert and training 
exercises at Quantico and Fort Leavenworth, ‘Human Terrain’ takes the 
viewer into the heart of the war machine and the shadowy collaboration 
between American academics and the armed services.</p>
<p>The other story is about a brilliant young scholar who leaves the 
university to join a Human Terrain team. After working as a humanitarian
 activist and winning a Marshall Scholarship to study at Oxford, Michael
 Bhatia returned to Brown University to conduct research on military 
cultural awareness. A year later, he left to embed as a Human Terrain 
member with the 82nd Airborne in Afghanistan. On May 7, 2008, en route 
to mediate an intertribal dispute, his humvee hit a roadside bomb and 
Bhatia was killed along with two other soldiers.</p>
<p>Asking what happens when war becomes academic and academics go to war, the two stories merge in tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> am doing a large amount of data entry
 today and do not have much time for writing. But, below are some posts 
and articles I enjoyed in the last week.</p>
<p><a href="http://springboarder.blogspot.com/2009/11/us-navy-americas-unrecognized-public.html">The U.S. Navy: America’s Unrecognized Public Health Shield</a> – </p>
<blockquote><p>Not too many Navy people know their organization serves 
on the front line of America’s disease defenses. Even fewer officers 
know–or even care–that the Navy occasionally beats the Centers For 
Disease Control and Prevention at disease detection, discovering, for 
example, the first domestic case of H1N1 Influenza.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/20728/state_of_the_worlds_vaccines_and_immunizations_2009.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+issue%2Fhealth_science_and_technology+%28CFR.org+-+Issues+-+Health%2C+Science%2C+and+Technology%29">State of the World’s Vaccines and Immunizations, 2009</a> – </p>
<blockquote><p>“The State of the world’s vaccines and immunization 
(Third edition) is a call to action to governments and donors to sustain
 and increase funding for immunization in order to build upon the 
progress made so far in meeting the global goals. It focuses on the 
major developments in vaccines and immunization since 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2009/11/agricultural-development-teams.html">Agricultural Development Teams</a> -</p>
<blockquote><p>USAID does not have the agricultural specialists needed 
for the mission in Afghanistan, but the National Guard sure does. They 
have been especially successful in Ghazni.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/11/10/risk_to_aid_workers_goes_up_in_2009">Risk to aid workers goes up in 2009</a> -</p>
<blockquote><p>The world is less safe for aid workers, access to needy 
communities in conflict is on the decline, and aid is increasingly tied 
to military or other strategic objectives. These are among the gloomy 
conclusions of Development Assistance Research Associates (DARA), an aid
 watchdog, as it releases its 2009 Humanitarian Responsiveness Index 
today.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://duckofminerva.blogspot.com/2009/11/tallying-collateral-damage_16.html">Tallying Collateral Damage</a> -</p>
<blockquote><p>So are unintentional civilian deaths trending up or down 
in absolute terms and / or as a percentage of all civilian deaths? This 
analysis suggests that collateral damage rather than war crimes now 
constitute the majority of civilian deaths in international wars 
worldwide, and that the total number of collateral damage deaths is 20 
times higher than at the turn of the last century.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/2009/11/15-in-helmand-aar-pictures-wor/">The powerpoint of 1st Battalion, 5th Marines’ after action report</a>
 is making its rounds online. Important to Conflict Health readers, the 
presentation reveals a softer side of Afghanistan counterinsurgency 
strategy: development, making friends, and protecting civilians. This is
 exactly the type of strategy recently pitched by General Stanley A. 
McChrystal.</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt of 15 slides from that presentation. Realize that
 these slides are not for the press or the American public. They are by 
Marines, for Marines. It is an insider’s view of a new type of American 
strategy in Afghanistan.</p>

 Alexander Downes uses a dataset on civilian deaths in wartime to 
conclude that governments kill civilians for two reasons: (1) to reduce 
the risk to their own military and (2) to seize territory. It is a good 
study, offering a mix of quantitative analysis and historical case 
studies. I often look at Downes’ book as a model for my own 
dissertation.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>t seems everyone is going Dutch these 
days. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal recently triumphed a softer Afghanistan
 strategy focusing on civilian protection and development. This week, 
the LA Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-dutch13-2009nov13,0,1314326.story">published a piece on a similar strategy already done by Dutch forces</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Dutch planners said they’ve concentrated on community 
development nearly as much as military security and have worked to 
ensure that complex tribal, political and governmental interests had a 
stake in building schools and other civilian projects. This, they hoped,
 would encourage residents to protect the structures against Taliban 
attacks, even if the process required far more time and effort than 
paying foreign contractors to throw up a showcase project.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I am happy to see Dutch forces in Afghanistan getting some well deserved attention.</p>

unlikely; a UN operation would amount an acknowledgement by the Mexican

 this is only the beginning of the fight. If Shah is confirmed, he takes
 over an organization struggling to find its way. More and more federal 
organizations are taking big steps into the development world, most 
notably the US military. If USAID is to remain relevant, Shah must build
 solid and productive relationships with these newcomers, turning 
usurpers into partners. If he doesn’t, USAID risks becoming sidelined to
 the strategic development goals of the US military and other 
organizations. I do not envy Shah, but wish him luck.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">M</span>y first introduction to the concept of human security was from the <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/">Human Security Report Project</a>
 at Simon Fraser University. As a political scientist, I knew of many 
conceptualizations of conflict, but had never heard about human 
security. At that early stage of my education, I was developing my first
 personal opinions on conflict, what it is, and what it is not. From an 
undergraduate background focusing on global health, my view of conflict 
went beyond the traditional focus. Conflict are more than generals, 
tactics, and strategy. Conflict are also about damaged roads, fleeing 
civilians, and a loss of stability. That idea crystalized when I 
stumbled upon <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=344&amp;Itemid=69">this definition of human security</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Unlike traditional concepts of security, which focus on defending 
borders from external military threats, human security is concerned with
 the security of individuals.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The sentence encapsulated my own beliefs eloquently and simply. 
Conflicts threaten people. Since then, I have been an avid follower of 
the Human Security Report Project. Now, the project is using two blogs 
to offer a human security perspective on AfPak. Both the <a href="http://www.afghanconflictmonitor.org/">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="http://www.pakistanconflictmonitor.org/">Pakistan Conflict Monitors</a>
 are aggregators of human security information on the conflicts and are 
worthwhile readings for anyone in the field. Check them out.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span> while ago, an internet flash game called <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/DarkRealmStudios/pandemic-2">Pandemic 2</a>
 became popular in some circles. In the game, players manipulate a 
disease’s characteristics (symptoms, resistances, etc…) to develop the 
deadliest possible pandemic. Simply put, players design diseases to wipe
 out the human race.</p>
<p>Play Pandemic 2 for any significant length of time and you quickly 
realize why the game is so difficult:&nbsp; Madagascar. In the game, 
Madagascar has a hairpin trigger for closing its borders, making 
infecting the island nation almost impossible.</p>
<p>Madagascar’s behavior in the game has started an ongoing internet joke about what goes on in <a href="http://i286.photobucket.com/albums/ll100/CaptainFailcon/SHUTDOWNEVERYTHING.jpg">high level policy discussions</a> in the government during the simulated pandemic (one example is shown on the right).</p>
<p>The punchline has a ring of truth. Last spring, Mexico <a href="http://www.livingstonintl.com/news_print.aspx?newsId=1820&amp;locale=en-ca">shut down the country</a>
 for days to counter H1N1. But, is closing down a country (or even part 
of a country) actually a good option in the real world? Only if you face
 a biblical plague.</p>
<p>The economic cost of closing down (or closing off) a country for any length of time is immense. It is a lesson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic_in_Mexico#Economic_Impact">Mexico learned the hard way</a>.
 Not only does the domestic economic activity of a state take a major 
hit, the closure fuels fears amongst international trading partners that
 states are unstable and unreliable. Investors like policy stability. 
States prone to shutting down in the face of pandemics risk becoming 
less appealing investment locations. As globalization and climate change
 make pandemics more common, countries with reputations for resiliency 
during outbreaks will become attractive investment locations. The 
tendency of Pandemic 2′s Madagascar to close its borders at the 
slightest sign of danger would make it an foreign direct investment 
(FDI) pariah. Unless of course, we faced the perfect pandemic, in which 
case, see you there.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he Army Capstone Concept (ACC) is a 
document framing the future direction of US Army training and doctrine. 
Brig. Gen. McMaster has posted a <a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/doc/Army%20Capstone%20Concept%20V%202%207.2.pdf">draft version of the ACC online</a>, and <a href="http://attackerman.firedoglake.com/2009/09/24/the-frigging-army-capstone-concept-is-at-small-wars-journal/">is even looking for feedback from the online conflict community</a>.</p>
<p>I have only briefly browsed the document, but one thing is clear: 
civilians, human security, history, culture, social science, and human 
terrain have a central role in the new ACC. This is a sea change from 
the last ACC, which emphasized the importance of advanced technology. 
Check out a summary of the ACC in this Army video below:</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">A</span> report published by the <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/revenge_drones">New America Foundation</a>
 estimates up to 320 Pakistani civilians have died in US drone-based 
airstrikes. The statistic was estimated from an analysis of news 
reports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We restricted our analysis to reports in the <em>New York Times, Washington Post,</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em>,
 accounts by major news services and networks–the Associated Press, 
Reuters, Agence France-Presse, CNN, and the BBC–and reports in the 
leading English-language newspapers in Pakistan–<em>The Daily Times</em>, <em>Dawn,</em> and <em>The News</em>–as well as those from Geo TV, the largest independent Pakistani television network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a summary of the results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not possible to differentiate precisely between militant and 
civilian casualties because the militants live among the population and 
don’t wear uniforms, and because the militants have the incentive to 
claim that all the casualties were civilians, while government sources 
tend to claim the opposite. However, of those killed in drone attacks 
from 2006 through mid-October 2009, between 500 and 700 were described 
in reliable press reports as militants, or some 66 to 68 percent.</p>
<p>Based on our count of the estimated number of militants killed, the 
real total of civilian deaths since 2006 appears to be in the range of 
250 to 320, or between 31 and 33 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report offers a counterargument to the growing number of 
‘offshore balancers’, who argue the United States should withdraw all 
ground forces and instead bomb Afghanistan and Pakistan from afar. 
Forcing civilians and militants to keep on eye on the sky <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/no-victory-through-offshore-balancing/">is not victory</a> as currently defined. In their words, “the drone program is a tactic, not a strategy”.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>rom time to time, I highlight blogs 
that have moved to the top of my daily reading list. Here are three 
conflict and health blogs that I have been thoroughly enjoying with my 
morning coffee. Check them out and consider adding them to your RSS 
reader.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://vethno.com/">VethnoGraphy</a>.</b> Craig Kiebler’s
 blog focuses on agricultural and veterinary infrastructure, and their 
relationship with society. In practice, posts often mix global health, 
veterinary science, and conflict in one soupy delicacy. Why should you 
read it? Because it is fascinating and (more importantly) original. You 
can read about child health, HIV, and swine flu on a dozen great blogs, 
but VethnoGraphy is the only place writing exclusively on the 
relationship between animals and global health.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.terraplexic.org/current-intelligence/"><b>CTLab’s Current Intelligence.</b></a> I don’t think I have given the Complex Terrain Laboratory enough credit. Michael Innes (who just published <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com//articles/2009/10/12/the_safe_haven_myth?page=0,1">two</a> <a href="http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/10/12/the_sound_of_silence">pieces</a> at Foreign Policy) and John Matthew Barlow have put together a serious team of contributors, minus <a href="http://www.terraplexic.org/current-intelligence/author/warandhealth">one lucky guy who snuck in under the radar</a>. Don’t believe me? Check out this nearly one thousand word post by Professor Charli Carpenter (founder of <a href="http://duckofminerva.blogspot.com/">The Duck of Minerva</a>) on the Russia-Georgia War.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://warisboring.com/">War is Boring.</a></b> Freelance
 journalist David Axe has turned his little blog into a solid 
publication, with one correspondent just returning from Afghanistan and a
 second just leaving. The site publishes article length posts on armed 
conflict at least three times a week, often with original photography. 
War is Boring is one of the few great independent war journalism blogs.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n May, Adam Elkus <a href="http://redteamjournal.com/2009/05/h1n1-flu-as-system-perturbation/">examined the H1N1 in terms of system perturbation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mexico’s image has also taken a severe battering. Already
 portrayed in international media as a warzone riven by cartel violence,
 Mexico’s status as a possible origin point of the influenza is likely 
to have adverse public relations and economic effects long after the 
influenza outbreak extinguishes itself. Non-essential services in Mexico
 have currently ceased and 168 have already died from flu-like symptoms.
 China experienced similar embarrassment after the 2003 SARS epidemic 
and the 2006 Avian Flu outbreak, spurring calls for healthcare and 
governance reforms. Many international actors perceived the reforms that
 resulted as effective. By the time the 2008 Olympics rolled around, 
Avian Flu was a distant memory. As an Associated Press story notes, 
Mexico will likely face a similar pressure for reform because of its 
lackluster response to the outbreak…</p></blockquote>
<p>Could it have the same affect on the international stage? I won’t be 
holding my breath. Thomas P.M. Barnett defines system perturbation as <a href="http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/published/SystemPerturbation.htm">“like
 a giant stone dropped into a calm pond”, after which “…all bets are 
off. The old rule set evaporates, the new one is not yet gelled”</a>. 
For all their effects, epidemics (and pandemics) have historically been 
weak causes of this type of international reorganization. United States 
foreign policy was affected by the 1918 Spanish Flu, but the pandemic 
did little to change the fundamental structure of United States behavior
 towards other countries in the international environment. Compared with
 the aftermath of WWII, which brought about a new system of 
international relations (e.g. hegemony with responsibilities, 
international organizations), epidemics are rather ineffectual as agents
 of system perturbation. Epidemics are significant, but don’t expect 
them to reset the international environment.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>rom April 1775 to March 1776 the 
Continental Army lay siege to British forces in the town of Boston. The 
eleven month siege resulted in a major victory for George Washington’s 
scrappy army. Boston’s geography (a peninsula connected to the mainland 
by a narrow isthmus) is often credited for the lack of an early decisive
 engagement during the siege. The physical terrain worked against the 
attacker in any potential maneuver. However, some recent histories 
highlight another reason for the long stalemate: smallpox.</p>
<p>Smallpox flourished during the war. The highly virulent disease 
spread rapidly as soldiers on both sides clustered in unsanitary camps. 
The incidence was fueled by the steady supply of new recruits with no 
previous exposure. One early report in the war claimed that between 
30-35% of Washington’s troops were sick (not always smallpox) and unfit 
for duty (Becker 2004, 393).</p>
<p>Washington’s army was especially at risk from smallpox. While African
 Americans, Native Americans, and British troops commonly inoculated 
themselves to smallpox, American colonists widely scorned the practice. 
The inoculation procedure required the application of pus from a 
smallpox pustule onto the skin of an non-immune individual. Many New 
England colonist considered the practice repulsive — even blasphemous — 
and enacted heavy legal restrictions against it. As a result, Washington
 had great difficulty inoculating his troops and his army was 
perpetually at risk of debilitating smallpox epidemics within their 
ranks.</p>
<p>Historians debate why the British commander, General Howe, failed to 
fortify the Dorchester Heights, which overlooked his besieged town. 
While most historians blame the personal failings of Howe, Ann Becker 
argues that the epidemiological terrain made Howe consider a Continental
 offensive unlikely. During the siege, Washington commented in letters 
that smallpox existed throughout Boston and British troops inside the 
city were thoroughly inoculated. The Continental general considered 
smallpox “a weapon of defense they are using against us” and a “surety 
against any attempt of ours to attack” (George Washington to John 
Hancock and George Washington to Joseph Reed, both quoted in Becker 
2004, 399). Any attack on Boston would expose the Continental Army to 
smallpox in Boston, giving the inoculated British troops a significant 
advantage. Thus, General Hume — surrounded by a smallpox epidemic — felt
 secure from Continental attack.</p>

 profiles the hand over of the largest US military hospital in Iraq. 
Based in the Green Zone, Ibn Sina Hospital has provided medical care to 
US servicemen, civilians, and insurgents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After visitors pass through body searches at a pair of security 
checkpoints outside the hospital, the interior of Ibn Sina (named for a 
Ninth Century physician), looks a lot like a civilian medical center in a
 mid-sized American town: There is a long central hallway, a small 
emergency room, a few operating rooms and a pharmacy with an electronic 
sign that reads, “Now Serving ….”</p>
<p>In its supply rooms, stocked among shelves lined with boxes of 
bandages, bottles of sterile water and J-tubes used for opening airways,
 are surgical kit bags containing instruments needed to perform various 
types of surgical procedures.</p>
<p>But soon enough, it becomes clear that this hospital is something 
else. There is a special arms room for storing weapons. Many of the kits
 on the shelf are marked “amputation” — an operation carried out with 
numbing regularity at Ibn Sina over the years.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he decisive defeat of the LTTE in Sri 
Lanka’s northern region brought hope of ethnic reconciliation on the 
embattled island nation. However, a recent <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14564948&amp;fsrc=rss">Economist article</a> on the Tamil civilian population highlights a new conflict brewing.</p>
<p>After the May 17th defeat, over 260,000 mostly Tamil civilians were 
interned in 16 camps. Since then, by the government’s own account, only 
20,000 have been released. With many Tamils interned and off their land,
 thousands of Sinhalese families driven from land by LTTE during the 
long civil war are surging north to reclaim it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Irakandy, a short drive from Trincomalee, 1,050 Sinhalese, 
representing over 350 families, have gathered to reclaim land from which
 80 families were driven in 1985. … Priyantha Malvangoda, a well-dressed
 businessman from Colombo, says he and six siblings are all staking 
claims, his father having been driven from a nearby one-acre farm in 
1985.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The root of the conflict is a rift between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure">de jure</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a> ownership. Many of the Sinhalese coming north are carrying “<a href="http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14564948&amp;fsrc=rss">documents supporting claims to have bought the leaseholds to the land</a>” in former Tiger territory. However, for years (often decades) the land has been de facto owned and farmed by Tamil families.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka’s government must tread carefully. Post-war land disputes 
are powder-kegs. Supporting the Sinhalese owners could spark a new 
insurgency if young, male Tamil farmers feel their land was stolen from 
them by a racist government. Supporting the Tamil owners will alienate 
the government’s political base. Splitting the land will likely satisfy 
nobody.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">R</span>eaders are noticing the major change 
to War and Health that occurred over the weekend: we changed domains! 
After two years of activity, War and Health is growing up and getting a 
new name: Conflict Health.</p>
<p>Why the new name? War and Health’s name originated as a play off 
Tolstoy’s masterpiece. However, I was never happy with it. The site 
never focused exclusively on ‘wars’. Many issues discussed here (e.g. 
the collapse of Zimbabwe’s health system) could only be labeled ‘wars’ 
under the widest of definitions. Furthermore, over time my interest in 
the health implications of less-than-war political violence has grown 
considerably. Conflict Health reflects this broader focus.</p>
<p>What does this mean for RSS and newsletter readers? <i>Nothing</i>. 
War and Health’s RSS Feed and Mailing List will continue to work 
indefinitely. There is no need to change anything at your end. 
Furthermore, all links to War and Health content are automatically 
redirected to their Conflict Health equivalents. Simply put: all RSS 
feeds, Mailing Lists, War and Health URLs, and inbound links work.</p>
<p>So, sit back and enjoy the show.</p>

<p><em>“I am not an Arab or African, I am a Darfuri and my tribe now is called Refugee. We are all refugees”</em> -<a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L27345139.htm">Mohamed Hassan Yagoub</a></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">C</span>ountries are comprised of layers of 
systems. These network of systems promotes efficiency by reducing the 
cost to connect with other nodes in a system. Systems of roads reduce 
the cost to travel from your town (a node) to another town (a node). 
Systems of justice reduce cost by allowing individuals resolve their 
grievances through an established and open (e.g. laws are public) 
framework.</p>
<p>Now, let us look at a more complicated example: social relationships.
 Systems of relationships reduce the cost of social interaction. Meeting
 someone for the first time is costly. Utility is spent determining 
whether they are friend or enemy. Luckily, networks of social 
relationships reduce this cost by (amongst other things) signaling an 
individual’s status. For example, you are more wary of a friend of an 
enemy than a friend of a friend. These social cues are valuable for 
everyone in the network. Armed conflict can have a dramatic and perilous
 effect on networks of social relations.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1087" title="timberlandia-1" src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/timberlandia-1.png" alt="timberlandia-1" height="306" width="300"></p>
<p>Imagine a state, Timberlandia. Within Timberlandia exists a number of
 groups (red circles) connected via a network of relationships (red 
lines). Before the conflict these relationships are used for social 
support, sharing information, and trade. Families use the network to 
find cheap lodging in while traveling. Friends use the network to find 
information on jobs. Businesspeople use the network to find customers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1091" title="timberlandia-2" src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/timberlandia-21.png" alt="timberlandia-2" height="280" width="300"></p>
<p>During civil war some groups are forced to uproot and find safety in a
 neighboring states. The fighting disrupts the network by breaking up 
social relationships or eliminating nodes entirely. Disruption of nodes 
and relationships (fewer lines) reduces the efficiency-enhancing 
capacity of the social network. Friends have fewer people to call for 
work and businesspeople have a harder time finding customers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093" title="timberlandia-3" src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/timberlandia-32.png" alt="timberlandia-3" height="297" width="300"></p>
<p>Networks are organic. When disrupted, they rebuild connections. 
Separated by a border, the displaced nodes develop new social 
relationships with each other. That is, they build a new, diaspora 
social network (shown in blue). The nodes remaining in Timberlandia are 
busy too. The loss of nodes in their network has forced the 
establishment of new relationships to replace those lost. In the sense, 
the diaspora and remaining networks self-heal by building new 
relationships.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094" title="timberlandia-4" src="conflict-health-posts-200-300_files/timberlandia-41.png" alt="timberlandia-4" height="306" width="300"></p>
<p>Problems can arise when the diaspora nodes (and their social network)
 return home. Before the civil war there was one social network, 
however, now there are two networks of relationships. Unless properly 
addressed, these networks can compete and conflict for jobs, resources, 
and power.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">L</span>ast week, the Netherlands announced that the amphibious transport ship <a href="http://warisboring.com/?p=2599">HNLMS Johan de Witt wil</a><a href="http://www.informationdissemination.net/2009/09/smart-power-is-global-power.html">l participate in Africa Partnership Station</a>.
 The two month deployment is the Dutch Navy’s first major soft-power 
cruise. The deployment of the Johan de Witt demonstrates the growing 
Dutch interest in soft-power. But why?</p>
<p>Part of it has to do will the increasing acceptance of soft-power as a
 useful tool in international relations. Secretary of Defense Robert 
Gates argued as such two years ago and I whole-heartedly agree. However,
 there is likely another reason: soft-power cruises give navies missions
 for their ships.</p>
<p>The last eight years of war have been — apart from combat air 
support, sea-lift, and small maritime security operations — land-based 
affairs. As such, the US Navy played only a limited, supporting role in 
both conflicts. In Europe, national security threats are even more 
remote and European navies have few reasons to justify maintaining 
expensive blue-water fleets. Enter soft-power.</p>
<p>The possible benefits of soft-power cruises are numerous, but during 
the USS Nashville’s mission to West Africa, Captain Cindy Thebaud <a href="http://warisboring.com/?p=2599">stated</a>
 “the indicators [of success] will be long-term, not near-term”. In 
other words, soft-power is important, but impossible to measure. Thus, 
soft-power provides politicians and naval leaders with a politically 
convenient mission justifying naval budgets and not accountable for 
effectiveness.</p>
<p>I am a strong supporter of soft-power, particularly using naval 
assets. There are significant diplomatic and stability benefits to US 
armed forces providing services and training after disasters and in 
marginalized regions. But, soft-power mission effectiveness <em>is</em> 
measurable. If our goal is to develop soft-power into an meaningful tool
 of foreign relations, then missions must be judged on useful metrics.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>hat does a Ph.D. candidate do on a friday night? Kudos to those of you who that guessed <i>“drink beer and read 19th century books on British military mortality”</i>. Tonight I am perusing the pithily titled <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/mortalityofbriti00lond">Mortality
 of the British Army at Home, at Home and Abroad, and During the Russian
 War as Compared with the Mortality of the Civil Population in England</a>, written in 1858.</p>
<p>The book presents a number of tables and graphics, but these three caught my attention:</p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/ba-mortality1.jpg" alt="ba-mortality1.jpg" class="frame" height="315" width="600"></p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/ba-mortality2.jpg" alt="ba-mortality2.jpg" class="frame" height="302" width="600"></p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/ba-mortality31.jpg" alt="ba-mortality3.jpg" class="frame" height="320" width="600"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… [E]ach parallelogram of which represents the total sum of life 
among 10,000 men, between 20 and 40 years of age, entering the army, and
 remaining on home-service, and among the same number of Englishmen 
taken, at the same ages. The left-hand line of each parallelogram shows 
that all starts alike; but the black wedge, which represents the 
progress of death among the various classes, it will be observed, has a 
very different slope in each separate parallelogram.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More interesting, the authors use the graphics to argue that greater 
attention should be paid to public health in the English army:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Each parallelogram also represents the total money value of 10,000 
men between the ages of 20 and 40, as well as the loss of value from 
loss of life at each succeeding year between the two ages. … In the case
 of the army, the country incurs great expense in educating the soldier 
for his duties, … [and] it may be fairly stated that the whole excess of
 money loss between that in healthy districts and that in the army, as 
represented by the difference in area of the black wedges, might be 
saved to the tax-payers of the country.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, good public health practices in the military save 
money. Unfortunately, many developing world militaries have yet to make 
this connection. Soldiers are expensive. When you include training, 
transportation, housing, equipment, and the opportunity cost of removing
 young men from economic production, all but the most neglected soldiers
 are a serious financial weight to a state. Protecting their health 
protects the bottom-line.</p>
<p>And, if you feel the inkling, the entire book is in public domain and can be downloaded <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/mortalityofbriti00lond">here</a>.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">C</span>hris Blattman, Assistant Professor of Political Science and Economics at Yale and blogger, has <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/data/sway/">released the datasets from his research on war affected youth in Uganda</a>. This is great, original data from extensive fieldwork. Three cheers for Blattman!</p>
<blockquote><p>
  SWAY is a research program in northern Uganda dedicated to 
understanding the scale and nature of war violence, the effects of war 
on youth, and the evaluation of programs to recover, reintegrate, and 
develop after conflict. See the <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/projects/sway/">SWAY project page</a> for details.</p>
<p>We have now posted the <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/documents/data/sway/SWAY.Replication.zip">full STATA 10 dataset and replication files</a>.</p>
<p>The data have been cleaned and anonymized, with accompanying 
codebook. Raw data and cleaning code are restricted, but may be 
available on request.</p>
<p>The data are collected from three main survey questionnaires:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li><a href="http://chrisblattman.com/documents/data/sway/H.eng.final.doc">Household survey</a> (2005)</li>

<li>Phase 2 (Females) <a href="http://chrisblattman.com/documents/data/sway/">Individual survey</a> (2007)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  At present, replication “.do” files (for STATA 10) are included for two academic papers: <a href="http://www.chrisblattman.com/documents/research/2009.Consequences.RESTAT.pdf">The Consequences of Child Soldiering</a>, and <a href="http://www.chrisblattman.com/documents/research/2009.V2V.APSR.pdf">From Violence to Voting</a>. Replication files for the two UNICEF reports are available upon request, in admittedly unpolished form.

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n September 1st, the Washington Post’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/31/AR2009083102912.html">George Will put a voice behind an increasingly popular alternative strategy for Afghanistan</a>:
 “America should do only what can be done from offshore, using 
intelligence, drones, cruise missiles, airstrikes and small, potent 
Special Forces units, concentrating on the porous 1,500-mile border with
 Pakistan, a nation that actually matters”. Naval blogger <a href="http://www.informationdissemination.net/2009/09/george-will-offshore-balancer.html">Galrahn points out</a>
 that Will is advocating the strategy of offshore balancing. The problem
 is that offshore balancing in Afghanistan cannot produce victory, only 
prevent defeat.</p>
<p>In a 2008 Newsweek article, the father of offshore balancing, international relations scholar John Mearsheimer, l<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/177380">aid out the concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As an offshore balancer, the United States would keep its military 
forces—especially its ground and air forces—outside the Middle East, not
 smack in the center of it. Hence the term ‘offshore.’ As for 
‘balancing,’ that would mean relying on regional powers like Iran, Iraq 
and Saudi Arabia to check each other. Washington would remain 
diplomatically engaged, and when necessary would assist the weaker side 
in a conflict. It would also use its air and naval power to signal a 
continued U.S. commitment to the region and would retain the capacity to
 respond quickly to unexpected threats, like Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait 
in 1990.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Offshore balancing is cheap, requiring at least one carrier group in the
 Arabian Sea and increased land-based air assets in Diego Garcia and 
perhaps Iraq. These forces could conduct airstrikes on Taliban targets 
to assist Afghan government forces. Offshore balancing is also not new. 
In 1999, NATO forces flew 38,000 combat missions against Yugoslav 
troops, forcing them out of Kosovo. However, the trillion dollar 
question is this: what would an offshore balancing victory in 
Afghanistan look like?</p>
<p>In 1999, NATO airpower did not defeat Milošević, it only drove him to
 the bargaining table. This result is unlikely to be repeated in 
Afghanistan. Years of airstrikes — essentially offshore balancing — 
against the Taliban and their allies in Pakistan’s tribal region have 
yet to force Osama bin Laden or Mullah Omar to negotiate. Even if they 
did offer to negotiate like Milošević, is this a victory the US public 
would accept? Not a chance.</p>
<p>The strategic use of airpower is about coercion, not victory. Despite
 all the advances in technology, victory still requires boots on the 
ground. Granted they do not have to be American boots, but victory is 
far more likely if they are. Offshore balancing can prevent the Taliban 
from defeating the Afghan government, by bombing the villages they are 
staying in and the roads they are driving on. But, preventing defeat is 
not victory. Airpower can force the Taliban to keep one eye on the sky, 
but not to give up the fight. Victory in Afghanistan requires reliable, 
sustainable, capable ground forces to protect and win the hearts and 
minds of the Afghan people and through their support, a stable state. 
Ironically, the only losers in offshore balancing would be these same 
Afghan people, trapped between the brutal Taliban, the undisciplined 
Afghan army, and the American cruise missile.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">H</span>1N1 is spreading around the world. The disease has infected thousands, including members of the <a href="http://warandhealth.com/h1n1-at-the-coast-guard-academy/">US military</a> and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/30/world/main5275268.shtml">Colombian President Alvaro Uribe</a>. Is H1N1 a threat to national, regional, or international security? Only if we make it one.</p>
<p>H1N1 can kill, but not significantly more than the seasonal flu. Since first being identified in April, there has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic_by_country">3,402 confirmed deaths from H1N1</a>
 worldwide. By comparison, tens of millions died in the first six months
 of the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic. The present danger is not from the 
disease, but from our overreaction.</p>
<p>Public hysteria can trigger responses worse than the disease. In April, after only eight H1N1 fatalities, the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2009-04/2009-04-30-voa5.cfm?CFID=283552840&amp;CFTOKEN=95310738&amp;jsessionid=88302f310d94c43e9a1a3647783a5a9642a5">Mexican government shut down non-essential functions for five days and advised citizens to stay in their homes</a>. The economic cost of this ‘treatment’ could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>H1N1 was not the first epidemic, and will not be the last. 
Governments must tackle epidemics as they would other natural disasters:
 assisting citizens while minimizing the disruption to economic, social,
 and security activity. If we do not change how the public perceives and
 understands epidemic-disasters, our overreaction could be worse than 
the diseases themselves.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he Swedish Committee for Afghanistan has accused the US 10th Mountain Division of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/09/07/afghanistan.hospital/index.html">storming a hospital while searching for a Taliban leader</a>.
 Afghan policemen with the US force allegedly “tied up four hospital 
guards and searched patients’ relatives, broke into the nutrition ward 
and ultrasound room, and searched the female ward of the hospital”. This
 is the second time in recent weeks ISAF forces have pursued Taliban 
forces into health facilities.</p>
<p>Late last month, a US AH-64 Apache helicopter <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/helicopter-opens-fire-on-afghan-medical-clinic/article1266342/">attacked an Afghan medical clinic in Paktika</a>
 while chasing Taliban fighters. A Taliban commander had entered the 
clinic seeking treatment. According to the ISAF: “After ensuring the 
clinic was cleared of civilians, an AH-64 Apache helicopter fired rounds
 at the building ending the direct threat and injuring the targeted 
insurgent in the building”. While there are no reports of health 
professionals killed in the US attack, the damage of the health clinic 
is no doubt extensive. Afghan civilians in the clinic’s catchment area 
will suffer over the next few weeks/months until the clinic can be 
returned to full operations.</p>
<p>These are the types of incidents where the coalition can win the 
battle, but lose the war. Interfering with a health facilities 1) 
delegitimizes coalition forces and the Afghan government; damages the 
health (and therefore economy) of the local population; provides 
propaganda material for Taliban forces; hurts the relationship between 
NGOs and ISAF; and turns global public opinion against the coalition. 
Put bluntly, attacking hospitals is bad, both for the attacker and the 
civilian population.</p>

<p>The New York Times has a short video story on <a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/08/28/world/1247464275829/guns-and-stethoscopes.html">a new Thai Army program attempting to win hearts and minds through medical care</a>.
 Since 2004 ethnic Malay muslims have clashed with the country’s 
buddhist majority for more autonomy. Recently, government troops have 
surged the southern provinces to quell the violence. However, Thai Army 
medics and doctors accompanying the troops army providing local 
villagers with basic medical care to soften the sting of military 
operations.</p>
<p>Will it win hearts and minds? Probably not. A quick visit by an army 
doctor is not enough to counter the friction caused by infantry 
patrolling through people’s villages and homes. However, the medical 
program, along with other development projects, will slow the growth of 
local resentment towards the military operations. More interestingly, 
the program might soften the Thai military’s behavior towards the local 
muslim villagers. Providing medical care could shape the military’s 
perception of its own role as supporting fellow countrymen as opposed to
 patrolling remote and unfriendly territory.</p>

<p>Recently, the US Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort returned from a four
 month humanitarian deployment to Central and South America. The mission
 was the project of <a id="ppdn" title="Admiral James Stavridis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Stavridis" name="ppdn">Admiral James Stavridis</a>,
 considered by some to be “the next Petreus”. While we will know more 
after the release of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), it is a good 
bet that health diplomacy missions like the Comfort’s are going to play a
 more central role in Navy operations in the future.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>t is laughable how much time I spend 
hunting for datasets. For reasons beyond understanding, datasets tend to
 reside in the dark, unindexed, unvisited alleys of the internet. 
Finding a dataset is akin to discovering the Northwest Passage. For this
 reason I am happy for a growing number of sites offering to help.</p>
<p>The latest contender in this field is <a href="http://infochimps.org/">Infochimps</a>, which claims help “find any dataset in the world”. The reality falls far short. War and Health <a href="http://warandhealth.com/type/data/">maintains a active list</a> of relevant datasets with links to help fellow researchers. My attempts to find some of those datasets on <a href="http://infochimps.org/">Infochimp</a>
 failed completely. Now, I am up for giving them the benefit of the 
doubt, they are still in beta. Overall, I am just excited to see a new 
wave to these dataset search engines to hit the internet.</p>
<p>Good luck Infochimps, I will keep an eye on your progress.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he NYtimes new <a href="http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/why-do-bullets-kill-more-soldiers-in-iraq/#comment-38049">At War</a> blog has an <a href="http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/why-do-bullets-kill-more-soldiers-in-iraq/">interesting infograph</a>
 on the lethality of weaponry on American forces in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. The writer, C.J. Chivers, uses the infograph to highlight a
 quantitative anomaly in the data: Why are bullets more lethal in Iraq 
than Afghanistan?</p>
<p>The answer is two fold: training and terrain. Iraqi insurgents often 
have prior professional military training and thus are more accurate 
shots. Furthermore, the urban terrain of Iraq forces American and 
insurgents into close proximity, 1) allowing little time for bullets to 
slow down in flight and 2) increasing the probability of multiple hits 
on a single person. By contrast, the typically poor training of Afghan 
fighters and mountainous terrain lend to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_and_pray">spray and pray</a> at extended ranges. The end result is that bullets in Afghanistan are slower on impact and less concentrated.</p>
<p><a href="http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/why-do-bullets-kill-more-soldiers-in-iraq/#comment-38049">Wes Morgan’s comments</a> on the <a href="http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/why-do-bullets-kill-more-soldiers-in-iraq/#comment-38049">At War</a> blog offer additional insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would echo the comment about engagement ranges. I’ve only spent 
time in the two places briefly (as an embed), but my understanding is 
that insurgents actually do a lot more shooting in Afghanistan than in 
Iraq — but in Afghanistan it is often sustained AK/RPK/PKM fire from a 
considerable distance, particularly in the south of the country, whereas
 in Iraq it is often in [close quarters battle] environments where the 
shooter, even if he’s not a great shot, has a better chance of getting a
 kill.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baghdad-Sunrise-Brigade-Commanders-BAGHDAD/dp/B001TIG6V4%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dwarandhea-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001TIG6V4">Baghdad at Sunrise</a>
 by Colonel Peter Mansoor. The book is primarily a personal account of 
his deployments to Iraq. However, at one point the Petreus COINista 
digresses into a discussion on the myth of humanitarian neutrality in 
modern warfare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[After the bombing of the UN compound in Iraq on September 22, 2003]
 … The implications were clear. The insurgents and terrorists viewed any
 organization that was helping to stabilize the situation — whether 
ostensibly neutral or not — as aiding what they deemed to be an illegal 
occupation. … Although U.S. soldiers had at one time barricaded the 
access road adjacent to the Canal Hotel [site of the UN compound], the 
obstacles were removed at the behest of UN personnel, who were uneasy 
with the highly visible military presence. Ultimately, the assumption 
and appearance of neutrality provided no barriers to insurgent attacks. 
The rising vulnerability of international and nongovernmental 
organizations in the world today is an unfortunate fact. In a world of 
failed states, global terrorist movements, and progressively more 
virulent religious dogma and extremist ideologies, civilians and those 
who support them are increasingly targeted for political advantage, and 
emblems such as the UN globe and the Red Cross no longer confer immunity
 from attack. After the departure of most UN personnel, NGOs became the 
next target — but they, too, failed to heed the lesson of this bloody 
reality.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mansoor is partly correct. Humanitarian neutrality is a myth, but 
this is neither a new development or caused by “failed states, global 
terrorist movements, and progressively more virulent religious dogma and
 extremist ideologies”. During the Spanish-American war, the admittedly 
yellow-journalist Davis Crane observed that Spanish sharpshooters 
“spared neither the wounded nor recognized the Red Cross, they killed 
the surgeons and the stewards carrying the litters, and killed the 
wounded men…” (Cirillo 2004, 119). On the flip side, before their fall, 
the extremist and dogmatic Tamil Tigers allowed the Sri Lankan 
government to run hospitals in Tiger controlled territory. Attacks on 
humanitarians are out of strategic and tactical opportunity. Rebels, 
regardless of dogma and ideology, are outnumbered and outgunned. They 
attack what they can get away with. If the biggest vulnerable targets 
are humanitarians, and killing humanitarians does not threaten the 
terrorists sources of economic support, they might very well be inclined
 to attack.</p>

<p>Inspired by Israeli’s security fence, India <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/women-deployed-to-indias-wall-of-death/">is building</a> a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Bangladeshi_Barrier">2,000 mile fence</a> along its border with Bangladesh, the length of the US-Mexico border. The fence is manned by 80,000 members of India’s <a href="http://bsf.nic.in/introduction.htm">Border Security Force (BSF)</a>.</p>
<p>Constructed to prevent Islamic militants from crossing into India, 
the fence is most known for the hundreds of civilians killed while 
farming and traveling along the border region. It is the sad unintended 
consequence of imposing a de jure border where de facto none exists. The
 deaths are the result of the infinitely steep learning curve for 
locals, one day they can visit a field, the next day they are shot doing
 just that. The BSF argues it is protecting India. It is a tenuous 
argument: BSF patrols have reportedly killed more Indians than 
Bangladeshis.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Contemporary-Warfare-Paul-Rexton/dp/1597972576%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dwarandhea-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1597972576">Drugs and Contemporary Warfare</a>,
 Paul Rexton Kan attempts to understand the relationship between drugs 
and armed conflict. Kan is not the first to connect the two topics, such
 as Gretchen Peters’ book on poppies in Afghanistan. However, Kan’s book
 is exceptional for developing an overarching theory on drugs and armed 
conflict in modern history. Kan knows what he is talking about. An 
associate professor at the U.S. Army War College, <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=850">Kan’s previous monograph</a> explores the implications of drug intoxicated irregular soldiers on the battlefield (available for download free).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Contemporary-Warfare-Paul-Rexton/dp/1597972576%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dwarandhea-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1597972576">Drugs and Contemporary Warfare</a>
 is organized into six chapters: Hazy Shades of War, Drugging the 
Battlefield, High at War, Narcotics and Nation-Building, Sober Lessons 
for the Future, and Shaky Paths Forward. Kan’s first chapter summarizes 
the history of the drug trade’s influence on warfare, with emphasis on 
conflicts after the Cold War. With insightful anecdotes, Kan both 
introduces readers to the topic and lays the groundwork for concepts 
presented later.</p>
<p>Chapter Two asks why drugs have become so common in modern conflict. 
Kan argues drugs provided armed groups with an alternative source of 
funding after the demise of their superpower patrons. The drying up of 
international financial support drove armed groups to develop complex, 
interdependent relationships with drug traffickers. In exchange for 
protection and military muscle, drug traffickers provided armed groups 
with income to support their operations. Kan’s interdisciplinary 
expertise shines in this chapter. His analysis goes beyond discussing 
drugs in aggregate, instead examining how the individual characters 
(growing, production, transportation, consumption) of each type of drug 
affects the behavior and strategy of armed groups.</p>
<p>Kan’s third chapter discusses the use of traditional, transshipped, 
looted, and synthetically produced drugs by combatants. Kan analyzes 
when regular and irregular forces promote or restrict drugs use amongst 
themselves and their enemies.</p>
<p>In Chapter Four, Kan argues drugs decrease the probability that armed
 groups will make and hold peace agreements. Specifically, the drug 
trade provides a means for group leaders to employ their constituents in
 post-conflict environments. Kan expands this discussion in Chapter 
Five, warning that forces in charge of enforcing peace agreement must 
take into account the interdependent relationship between armed groups 
and drug traffickers. You cannot attack one without damaging the other. 
When armed groups party of a peace agreement are heavily connected to 
drug traffickers, operations against the latter are a threat to the 
former.</p>
<p>Kan’s final chapter presents a series of strategies to address drugs 
in armed conflict. First, following political realism, the resources of 
major powers and military might could be brought to bear against the 
drug trade directly. Second, following liberalism, international regimes
 and norms could be established to erode the connection between 
narcotics and warfare. Third, the international society could concede 
that large scale international projects will have little effect and 
leave the problem to lower levels of governance. The final strategy, and
 the one Kan is most in favor of, would:</p>
<blockquote><p>… seek to develop a network of actors at various levels 
who would challenge he networks employed by warring groups that are 
involved in drug fueled conflicts. This approach requires a high degree 
of multilayered cooperation among nation-states, international 
organizations, NGOs, and local communities to cope with the dynamics of 
the intersection between the drug trade and warfare, combat the 
strategic use of drugs, and assist in moving ongoing drug-fueled 
conflicts to abeyant conflicts, to settled. (Kan 2009, 137)</p></blockquote>
<p>Kan’s book has much to offer. Readers are presented with a coherent 
and well cited exploration of the relationship between drugs and armed 
conflict. However, the book stumbles in two aspects. First, Kan ties 
together the strategic implications of narco-conflicts and the effect of
 drug use on the combatants themselves. Transitions between the two are 
often awkward. At times it feels akin to a book on superpower nuclear 
strategy including a chapter on the dangers of radiation exposure on the
 human body.</p>
<p>Second, the strategy Kan proposes is detached from political 
realities. His multilayered approach requires a network and 
infrastructure even the global health community can only dream about. It
 is unclear if he posits this strategy as a realistic option, or an 
ideal to which the international community should strive towards.</p>
<p>The weaknesses of the book are easily forgiven, for it succeeds in so many more areas than it fails. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Contemporary-Warfare-Paul-Rexton/dp/1597972576%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dwarandhea-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1597972576">Drugs and Contemporary Warfare</a>
 offers one of the first systematic attempts to incorporate drugs into 
the theory of armed conflict. It offers a new perspective on wartime and
 post-war behavior, based on a solid theoretical foundation. Kan’s book 
would be a welcome addition to the bookshelves of any student of modern 
conflict.</p>

<p>My fascination with military maps continues. Above is a beautiful 
full color map of the siege of Boston after the Battle of Bunker Hill, 
but before the taking of Dorchester Hill. The origin of the map is 
unknown to me. Click on the map for the full-sized version.</p>
<p>The siege of Boston is a prime example of disease affecting military 
strategy. After Washington’s forces took Dorchester Hill (pictured 
above) and forced the British to withdraw from Boston, the General could
 not enter the city immediately. Boston was blighted with small pox and 
Washington feared spreading the disease to his troops. Instead, he sent 
in a small contingent of soldiers with prior exposure to small pox, 
called ‘selectman’. Washington ordered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As soon as the selectmen report the town to be cleansed from 
infection, liberty will be given those who have business there to go in.
 The inhabitants belonging to the town will be permitted to return to 
their habitations, proper persons being appointed at the Neck, and at 
Charlestown Ferry, to grant them passes” (<span style="line-height: 13px;">Frothingham 1903, <span style="line-height: normal;">311).</span></span></p>

This weekend I corrected the problem by adding 15 of the top 
international relations journals to my feedreader.</p>
<p>To help out fellow IR scholars, I present a list of RSS feeds for international relations journals, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li>International Security</li>
<li>American Political Science Review</li>
<li>Journal of Politics</li>
<li>Journal of Peace Research</li>
<li>Journal of Conflict Resolution</li>
<li>International Organization</li>
<li>Conflict Management and Peace Science</li>
<li>Annual Review of Political Science</li>
<li>International Studies Quarterly</li>
<li>American Journal of Political Science</li>
<li>Foreign Affairs</li>
<li>International Affairs</li>
<li>Political Science Quarterly</li>
<li>World Politics</li>
<li>European Journal of International Relations</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can download the <a href="http://conflicthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ir-rss-feeds1.opml">IR RSS Feed list</a>
 here in an .opml file. To add to your RSS reader: 1) right click on 
link 2) select “save as”, 3) open your RSS feedreader, 4) click import, 
and 5) select the .opml file.<br>
Edit: Dan Nexon pointed out that I forgot the European Journal of International Relations. I have now added it to the .opml.</p>

<p>A team led by Dr. Adrian Bell and Prof. Anne Curry, with funding from
 the Arts and Humanities Research Council, have put up a stunning <a href="http://www.medievalsoldier.org/">new database</a> of military service records of medieval soldiers serving from 1369 and 1453:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The main campaigns of the period were to France but there were 
others to Flanders, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, a much
 wider geographical spectrum than before 1369. In addition, garrisons 
were maintained within England (such as that held at the Tower of 
London), the Channel Islands, Wales and the marches, as well as at 
Calais and in Gascony. In the fourteenth-century phase of the Hundred 
Years War, the English also held some garrisons in areas of northern 
France, and in the fifteenth century phase, there was a systematic 
garrison-based occupation of Normandy and surrounding regions…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the database’s primary purpose seems to be exploring the lives 
of individual soldiers of note, There are great many potential 
applications for large observation (large-n) quantitative studies of 
conflict and health. Variables in the database include: First Name, Last
 Name, Status, Rank, Captain’s Name, Commander’s Name, Year of Service, 
Nature of Activity, Reference Number, and Membrane. <a href="http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/soldier/database/Project-details.pdf">Read the project details</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For better or worse, the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> has played a role in many of Europe’s wars in the 20th century. Not only was the city’s streets the backdrop for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria">assassination</a>
 that triggers World War I, but from April 5, 1992 to February 29, 1996 
experienced the longest siege of a major city in modern history.</p>
<p>The city, called the ‘Jerusalem of Europe’ for its ethnic 
heterogeneity, was surrounded and besieged by Serbian forces. The 
Serbian forces uses artillery and snipers to wear down inhabitants. The 
fourty-six month siege destroyed 60 percent of the city’s buildings and 
killed more than 10,000.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/182-sarajevo-siege-map/">Strange Maps</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This map gives a <b>bird’s eye view</b> of Sarajevo during the siege, almost in the style of a naïve children’s painting.</p>
<ul>
<li>A red line indicates the border between the government-held city and Serbian-held surrounding areas.</li>
<li>The Serbian side of that line is stocked with the diverse instruments of raining death on the city below.</li>
<li>Many of Sarajevo’s landmarks are shown (mosques, churches, a 
football stadium), but not named; maybe someone familiar with the city 
can provide some help.</li>
<li>In the bottom left-hand corner, the UN-held airport is shown inside 
the Sarajevo line; in reality, Sarajevans could only access the outside 
world by going <i>below</i> the airport, via the tunnel that is shown just to the left of the cargo plane on the runway.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://theday.com/re.aspx?re=dc2824c8-c41e-4dae-8bd9-383e38805951">Ten percent</a> of the incoming Coast Guard Academy class has H1N1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We were expecting to see the number go up before it came back down 
because we had a lot of tests out still,” Petty Officer Ryan Doss, an 
academy spokesman, said Monday. “The flipside is that the number of 
people coming into the clinic feeling symptomatic has gone down. We hope
 it’s an indication that this is going to keep declining, but we’re 
going to stay prepared for anything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a decent amount of people out there with the opinion that 
“It’s just the flu”. They are right, it is just the flu this time. 
However, the procedures we put in place for the flu now will likely be 
the same used in an inevitable future outbreaks of a more virulent 
pathogen. To venture dangerously into a sports metaphor: H1N1 is simply 
the exhibition game before the start of the real thing. We get it right 
now so we know what to do when it the disease is far more serious.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">S</span>ince April 1st the US Navy <a href="http://fhp.osd.mil/aiWatchboard/pdf/DoD%20Pandemic%20%28H1N1%29%202009%20Summary-14%20July%20final.pdf">has reported 505 cases of H1N1 (Swine Flu) in active duty servicemen/women [pdf]</a>.
 For perspective, the Army, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard has had 
502, 323, 239, and 8 cases respectively. However, more than 20% (110) of
 the Navy’s cases occurred on the USS Bonhomme Richard, currently at 
sea. Even more startling, 61 of the Bonhomme Richard’s cases happened 
within the last eleven days. Simply put, 12% of the Navy’s total H1N1 
cases are on a single ship, on deployment, and within the last two 
weeks.</p>
<p>The Navy has so far been able to keep the USS Bonhomme Richard’s 
outbreak out of the news. The only mention of the outbreak is in the <a href="http://fhp.osd.mil/aiWatchboard/pdf/DoD%20Pandemic%20%28H1N1%29%202009%20Summary-14%20July%20final.pdf">DoD’s July 14, 2009 Global Surveillance Summary for H1N1 [pdf]</a> (pictured), read only by military health staff and nosy Ph.D. candidates.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3662" src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/bonhomme.png" alt="bonhomme" height="90" width="420"></p>
<p>While H1N1 is no more dangerous than the common flu, outbreaks of the
 virus have affected Naval operations in the past. After the USS Dubuque
 experienced at outbreak of around 20 cases of H1N1, it was scrapped as 
the assigned vessel for Pacific Partnership 2009, a humanitarian civic 
assistance mission to Kiribati, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, 
Solomon Islands and Tonga. Mission planners scrambled and accepted an 
offer by the Sealift Command and the Seventh Fleet to use the USNS 
Richard E. Byrd. The change in vessels forced the mission to be reduced 
to half of the original plan. On the vessel switch, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defenselink.mil%2FDODCMSShare%2FBloggerAssets%2F2009-06%2F06160914263220090615_Cully_transcript.pdf&amp;ei=ZTpeSpL7K5SwsgOK-NGoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGimvaeqvVzP8oawoYEeLad_SU4xw&amp;sig2=9N5w7P_Cql-mrFwtxEUvSA">Commodore Andrew Cully said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Originally, we were going to have roughly 180 medical folks and 
several engineers, a lot more than what we’ve had. And then now we had 
to down-scope somewhat, and [on the USNS Richard E. Byrd] I’m carrying, 
roughly, 50 medical professionals, 40 engineers, and then we’ll round it
 out with another 20 between my core staff and partner nations and 
NGOs.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, active outbreaks can spread quickly. This week, an <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/07/14/colorado.doolie.flu/index.html">H1N1 outbreak amongst freshman cadets at the Air Force Academy spread to sixty-seven students within ten days of the case</a>.
 The increased risk of spreading the disease in the cramped conditions 
of naval vessels is obvious. So, if in the next few weeks you hear 
reports of the USS Bonhomme Richard changing its mission due to a H1N1 
outbreak: 1) do not be surprised, and 2) remember you heard it here 
first.<br>

<p><span class="drop_cap">S</span>ixty seven of the 1,300 member freshman class at the Air Force Academy <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/07/14/colorado.doolie.flu/index.html">have or are suspected to have H1N1 influenza</a>.
 Seventy more have symptoms but either tested negative or have recovered
 (meaning we do not know how many of this group had H1N1). The cadets 
only arrived at the Air Force Academy on June 25 and in a little over 
ten days the first symptoms were reported.</p>
<p>In itself, this outbreak is of little importance. None of the 
recruits required hospitalization and the outbreak will burn itself out 
in a week or so. The only real casualty was the cancelation of the 
cadets’ first day off. However, the outbreak must stand as a warning on 
the dangers of infectious diseases in the military. This time it was an 
influenza, next time it could be something worse.</p>
<p>Despite the low danger of H1N1 influenza for young, healthy cadets, 
the Air Force should be commended for their quick action. The first 
signs of H1N1 appeared only a week ago and since then the freshman class
 was screened, suspected cases isolated, and healthy cadets continued 
activities with minimal disruption. Future outbreaks of other diseases 
are certain, in this case the Air Force has shown impressive readiness 
to respond to these emerging threats.</p>

 is a history of suffering in World War I, a description the author 
readily admits: “At the roots of the book lies the question of what can 
happen to a soldier between the moment he steps onto a train or ship 
bound for the theatre of battle an the point at which he is evacuated 
wounded, or whether dead or alive, buried in the ground” (pg. 1). 
Needless to say, the book is not a light read.</p>
<p>The book is divided into five parts: Battle, Body, Mind, Aid, and 
Death. Battle is a chronological history of the suffering on the Western
 Front. Body explores trench life, disease, and wounds. Mind examines 
shell shock (PTSD). Aid describes the medical services (or lack there 
of). Death looks at killing, being killed, and burial.</p>
<p>Van Bergen cannot be criticized on methodology. The book is 
impressively well researched (and cited), including qualitative and 
quantitative sources in numerous languages. Apart from the organization 
of the book itself, you see very little of the author in the pages. 
Readers are bounced from anecdotal accounts to descriptive statistics 
with little commentary or fanfare. This is not necessarily a negative, 
the sources speak for themselves. Their sheer, horrifying weight is 
ample to progress the book forward.</p>
<p>Whether on purpose or by accident, readers are left mostly alone in a
 dense text of grim personal accounts and tragic statistics. Where the 
author does introduce himself often seems out of place. At one point 
during a discussion of mustard gas the text digresses onto a quick 
commentary on wearing kilts in war, leaving readers jarred. The author 
also has the nasty habit of not properly introducing and defining new 
concepts. During the same description of gas weapons, the author 
awkwardly switches from referring to the weapons by their common name 
(mustard gas, chlorine gas, etc…) to referring to them by the the color 
of the artillery shell’s identification markings (yellow cross, green 
star, etc…) without connecting the two labels.</p>
<p>Finally, the author has the curious habit of including fictional 
descriptions in his sources. Readers are forced to be mindful of whether
 an anecdote is a primary source or the passage from a novel. I resorted
 to skipping fictional accounts when I came across them altogether, if 
only to keep separate in my head what was based on observation and 
imagination.</p>
<p>However, in the light of the book’s contribution these issues are quickly forgotten. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Before-Helpless-History-Medicine-Context/dp/0754658538%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dwarandhea-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0754658538">Before My Helpless Sight</a>
 is a powerful counter to the innumerable discourses on WWI tactics and 
strategy. Van Bergen pulls back the curtains of glorious offensives and 
magnanimous generals, revealing the grim, muddy reality of life on the 
Western Front. It is a story of pus, rats, hunger, dirt, disease and 
madness. You do not know World War I before reading this book.</p>

<p>Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Strange McNamara died today. He 
was 93. I never met him, but to me he was the embodiment of global 
politics and a major reason I decided to study international relations. 
Deborah Shapley said it best: “For better and worse McNamara shaped much
 in today’s world”.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n an early afternoon in April 2006, 
Sami Hamad walked up to the Rosh Ha’ir shwarma and felafel stand in Tel 
Aviv. The restaurant’s security guard, Binyamin Hafuta, took notice and 
stopped Hamad at the door. The restaurant had been the target of a 
suicide attack <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498871786&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">three months before</a> and the owners weren’t taking chances. Seconds later, Sami detonated his explosive device. <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1143498867972&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull">Seventy people were wounded and nine killed in the attack</a>, including the security guard. Did Hafuta’s actions save lives? Mark Harrison finds he likely did.</p>
<p>Bystanders interventions, such as challenging the attacker or 
informing security forces, is common. Out of the 103 Palestinian suicide
 attacks from 2000 to 2003, 40 experienced interventions by bystanders. 
Tragically, bystander interventions nearly always trigger an attack, 
killing the good samaritan. There are only two cases of interventions 
preventing an attack entirely.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/faculty/harrison/public/sct06postprint.pdf">2006 article [PDF]</a> in the journal <a href="http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/uter">Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism</a>,
 Harrison argues that interventions by bystanders reduce suicide attack 
casualties by preventing attackers from selecting optimal locations. The
 author finds 45.1 casualties occur on average when an attacker was not 
challenged, while only 16.9 casualties occur on average when a bystander
 intervened. He argues that bystander interventions take the initiative 
away from suicide attackers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Possibly, however, challenges in low-value locations prevented 
attackers from proceeding to higher-value targets. If the targets in 
Israeli society were arrayed in order of diminishing value … they would 
form steps on a ladder … The higher-value targets at the top of the 
ladder were cafés and buses; intermediate targets were commuter queues 
and shoppers in crowded streets and stores.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Think of the typical attacker as setting out to climb this ladder: to
 reach a café she had to pass a checkpoint, walk along a street, enter 
and leave a store, wait for a bus, and travel on it to the destination. 
At each step the attacker was screened by the watchful eyes of soldiers,
 security guards, shoppers, and commuters. By passing each step without 
challenge she gained access to a target of higher value. If challenged 
at any stage, she ended the game in sudden death. If this is the right 
analogy, then the effectiveness of screening is measured not just by the
 victims saved at each step but also by those saved because some 
attackers were challenged before they could reach targets of higher 
value.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harrison’s findings have strong implications. First, bystander 
interventions do save lives, but tragically almost always at the cost of
 the intervener. Second, populations under threat from suicide attackers
 benefit from a policy and norm of actively challenging suspicious 
individuals. The active challenging adds a level of randomness to a 
state’s security system that potential attackers must deal with. That 
is, while suicide attackers can plan on how to evade the static security
 locations, the chance of being challenged on every street and 
restaurant increases the probability a random intervention prevents or 
(more likely) mitigates an attack.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>n August 7th 1898, the American 
invasion force, crippled by yellow fever, started its evacuation of the 
island of Cuba. But, the withdrawal was not total. The black Ninth 
Infantry Regiment stayed behind to continue the occupation. It was 
believed that because of their race and the fact that many black 
volunteers came from southern states, they would be protected. These 
soldiers were nicknamed “Immunes”. However, mosquitos — the vector of 
yellow fever — are not influenced by skin color. By the end of their 
garrison duties, 73 of the 984 the soldiers contracted the disease.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n 1898 the United States invaded the 
Spanish controlled island of Cuba. This “splendid little war”, as John 
Hay called it, was an unbridled military success. In short order the 
Spanish forces on the island were defeated, surrendering on July 16th 
1898. Yet, within a month the US invasion would be forced to evacuate 
the island in what would later be called by one historian, “the American
 Dunkirk”.</p>
<p>The cause was <i>fiebre amarilla</i>, yellow fever. Transmitted by 
mosquitos, the disease quickly spread amongst the American occupation 
force. The infected were quarantined in a separate camp north of 
Siboney.</p>
<p>As yellow fever continued to cripple the US Army in Cuba, officers 
agreed that they must convince Washington to withdraw them from the 
island. Not wanting to damage their careers, a junior officer, Theodore 
Roosevelt, was chosen to draft the request. The same day, the US 
commander, General Shafter, asked Washington to allow the withdraw from 
Cuba, describing his force as an “army of convalescents”. By the time of
 his letter, 75% of the force in Cuba was unfit for service. The 
evacuation began on August 7th.</p>

<p>Acquiring sub-state data on conflict is difficult. Conflict — by its 
nature — often destroys the very infrastructure used to collect health 
and related data. The end result is that civil wars are often “black 
boxes” with regard to quantitative data. Below are three sources of 
sub-state data on civil wars relating to health.</p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/terrwar.jpg" alt="terr.war.jpg" class="frame" height="120" width="480"></p>
<p>The Global Terrorism Database has information on more than 80,000 
terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2007. GTD claims to be the most 
comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist actions available. The 
GTD has a clear data collection methodology and a detailed codebook (a 
manual detailing the dataset). <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">Click here to download</a>.</p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/colwar.jpg" alt="col.war.jpg" class="frame" height="120" width="480"></p>
<p>The Conflict Analysis Resource Center (CERAC) publishes a great 
dataset on the severity of the conflict in Colombia. The dataset has 
been used and described in a number of papers. Registration is required.

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/archwar.jpg" alt="arch.war.jpg" class="frame" height="120" width="480"></p>
<p>Ron Francisco has constructed a series datasets on the conflict 
events in six wars: Archidamian War, Ireland 1922-1923, Russia 
1917-1920, Spain 1936-1939, and the U.S. 1861-1865. The dataset 
includes: date, day, action type, location, each sides’ action, 
captures, injuries, deaths, description of event and original source. <a href="http://web.ku.edu/%7Eronfran/data/civilwars/index.html">Click here to download.</a></p>

<p>Nobody reads the saturday papers, so governments often announce items
 they want to keep quiet the friday before. Last friday, the US 
government announced <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/29/world/main5049204.shtml">Obama’s signing of a bill</a> doubling funding to a little known project started in 2007 tackling the environmental and health aftermaths of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange">Agent Orange</a> in Vietnam.</p>
<p>During the war the US military faced a dilemma. Pound for pound, the 
combined military might of the US armed forces could easily crush the 
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army in open battle. However, the dense 
jungle terrain made identifying enemy locations difficult. You cannot 
bomb what you cannot see. From 1961 to 1971 the US employed a form of 
herbicidal warfare to negate the protection afforded by the country’s 
dense vegetation. Millions of gallons of the dioxin containing herbicide
 were stored in Da Nang airport. From here, it was loaded onto USAF 
aircraft and blanketed over the Vietnam countryside to destroy crops and
 remove the concealment the dense vegetation provided Viet Cong and 
North Vietnameses troops.</p>
<p>Most of the money will be spent on cleaning the area around Da Nang 
airport and not the countryside. Agent Orange has been blamed for 
upwards of four millions cases of serious health problems. This number 
is disputed by the US government. Apart from the site at Da Nang 
airport, there are 25 other internationally recognized Agent Orange 
“hotspots” in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The move comes just days before Vietnamese Agent Orange activists <a href="http://www.thanhniennews.com/features/?catid=10&amp;newsid=49474">testified</a> in front of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Foreign_Affairs_Subcommittee_on_Asia,_the_Pacific,_and_the_Global_Environment">House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and the Global Environment</a>.
 Obama’s signature of the bill is likely intended to partially placate 
the activists before their testimony. There is a sizable research 
literature exploring the effect of domestic lobbies on foreign policy. 
Agent Orange offers a great example of global health lobbying, where a 
domestic lobby triggered international health diplomacy.</p>

The shell is made by defense mega-contractor <a href="http://www.raytheon.com/">Raytheon</a> and costs $150,000CA per shell. Ordinary high explosive shells cost $2,000CA.</p>
<p>Why use shells costing many times more than an average infantryman’s 
salary? Accuracy, argues Lt.-Col. Jim Willis, “It lands exactly where 
you want it to land”. The shells are accurate within 10 meters, current 
shells are only accurate to within 50 meters. The increased accuracy 
means one “smart-shell” can do the job of whole barrages with current 
shells.</p>
<p>The new shells might counter a trend <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6615781.stm">civilian casualties</a>
 in the Afghan campaign for three reasons. First, the GPS guided shells 
turn artillery batteries into low (relatively) cost precision 
airstrikes, capable of collapsing a single structure on demand rather 
than carpeting the area with impacts. Second, less rounds fired reduces 
the risk of introducing <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">exploded</span>
 unexploded ordinances into an area. Third, the shells reduce the need 
to use massive airborne ordinances. In instances when precision strikes 
are required the primary option currently available to Coalition forces 
is an airstrike. However, precision airstrikes typically use ordinances 
with hundreds of pounds of high explosives, much more than is often 
needed to eliminate the threat. The “overkill” of these large bombs 
increases the risk of civilian casualties. The Excalibur shells are 
smaller and carry less high explosives, reducing the risk of civilian 
deaths.</p>
<p>However, counterintuitively, there is a risk the new shells will 
increase danger to civilians. Currently using artillery against 
insurgents in dense population centers is not an option, since the 
barrage would likely flatten the entire population center. Commanders 
with access to the new shells might have more confidence in striking the
 target and thus be more willing to fire into population centers.</p>
<p>Hypotheticals aside, I (and I think everyone) prefer more accurate to
 less, fewer required to more, and smaller boom to larger. If those are 
our guidelines the Excalibur seems well worth the price to our 
pocketbooks.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">P</span>risoners of war hold special status in
 the Westphalian system. Michael Walzer describes their position as “a 
strange world this side of the hell of war … deprived of the relative 
security of political or social membership” (1969, 779).  Yet, prisoners
 of war do not exist on humanity’s periphery but at its center. Mustered
 from the society of the state, their capture marks a social and legal 
transition to a new society whose members were titled by a nineteenth 
century theorist as the “citizens of the world” (Walzer 1969, 778). 
Prisoners of war simultaneously exist under the jurisdiction of their 
homeland, their capturer, and humanity at large.</p>
<p>Political science offers many paradigms by which to frame prisoners 
of war. These theories are the lenses through which we interpret 
observations and project predictions. We address two of these theories: 
realism and social constructivism.</p>
<p>Realists view the international system as dominated by interest. 
State behavior is determined by their want and power to acquire it. 
International relations regarding prisoners of war in a realist world is
 based on reciprocity. Prisoners are akin to hostages, held by states to
 ensure reciprocal treatment toward their own citizens captured by enemy
 states.</p>
<p>Constructivists view the world as a social construction created 
through a shared understanding of values. These values are transmitted 
through communication to create norms of behavior. Constructivists view 
prisoners of war as existing in a value based world. The actions of 
states regarding prisoners of war are based on the values, norms, and 
identities those states hold.</p>
<p>In this paper, we ask whether realism or constructivism offers 
greater explanatory leverage regarding prisoners of war in the 
Westphalian system. First, we place the discussion in context by 
introducing the foundational treaties and major historical phases of 
prisoners of war.  Second, we explore how both realism and 
constructivism view prisoners of war and what observable predictions 
those frameworks imply. Finally, we compare those predictions against 
the real world, using both historical case studies and textual analysis 
of international treaties. What appears below is not a research paper. 
We provide no definitive, comprehensive answers. Instead we offer only 
the crude architecture of what an answer could look like, that 
constructivism provides the greater explanatory leverage.</p>
<h2>Prisoners of War in International Relations</h2>
<p>The discussion of prisoners of war treatment has a long history. In 
early subsistence societies prisoners of war were often killed because 
low economic productivity limited the number of enemy warriors any 
society was able to support (Gelb 1973, 71). In civilizations requiring 
mass labor prisoners of war often become slaves. The most common 
practice was a combination of these two policies. Male prisoners were 
slaughtered or sacrificed and female prisoners were enslaved (Gelb 1973,
 72). This period is marked with a stark lack of coordination regarding 
the prisoners of war.</p>
<p>With time, basic coordination developed between warring parties 
regarding prisoners of war. Evidence of this can be found in Livy’s 
account of diplomatic exchanges between Rome, Greece, and Macedonia in 
202-203 CE. This dialog contains a discussion on the return of 
Macedonian soldiers and their commander, Sopater imprisoned by the 
Romans (Dorey 1957, 186). While limited, this is representative of a 
general movement toward a more organized and universal system on 
prisoners of war.</p>
<p>The Peace of Westphalia introduced a new system of political 
organization and through that, a new approach to prisoners of war. The 
chronic shortage of seamen in the fleets of Spain, France, and England 
during the 18th century led to the common practice of exchanging or 
ransoming prisoners during conflict (Anderson 1960, 77). The primary 
consideration determining whether these transactions took place “was not
 which power was losing the greater number of men, but which power 
needed the return of its prisoners more” (Anderson 1960, 78). There was 
no general international policy regarding exchanges, instead a cartel 
system was used wherein states agreed to either “all for all” or “man 
for man” transfers (Anderson 1960, 79). This cartel system represents 
the prototype of the modern prisoner of war legal and social framework.</p>
<p>The Hague Regulation of 1899, later revised in 1907, offered the 
first permanent, formal international prisoners of war agreement. The 
treaty was so highly regarded that American Commander Raymond Stone 
wrote in 1914:</p>
<blockquote><p> When … the Great War broke upon an astonished world, we 
rather took comfort to ourselves in the thought that no matter how 
swiftly and vigorously military operations might be prosecuted, the 
Conventions of Geneva and of The Hague would insure humane care and 
chivalrous treatment to the prisoners of war of both sides. (Stone 1919,
 406)</p></blockquote>
<p>Stone admits basing his idealism on two assumptions. First, the 
treaties were legally binding on the states in the conflict. Second, 
that “in this day and generation of high development and in the elements
 of morality and humanity the belligerents would feel themselves morally
 if not technically constrained to abide by the principles…” (Stone 
1919, 406). Stone’s optimism was not entirely misplaced. World War I saw
 marked improvements for prisoners of war. Still, during the war the 
life of prisoners was harsh and many modern prisoner rights were not yet
 codified. It would be thirty years and another world war before the 
current legal institution developed.</p>
<p>The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are the core framework dealing with 
prisoners of war. The rules codified in the treaties apply to all wars 
between all signatories and leave few issues unaddressed. Unlike the ad 
hoc agreements of the cartel system which focused on the physical 
exchange of prisoners, the Geneva Conventions focus on the rights of the
 prisoners themselves. The Conventions includes detailed agreements on 
the discipline, diet, treatment, forced labor, housing, services, and 
the legal definition of prisoners of war. The 1949 treaties are the last
 major international agreement on prisoners of war and mark the most 
recent step in a historical trend toward more organized, formalized 
legal institutions dealing with prisoners of war.</p>
<h2>Prisoners of War in Realism</h2>
<p>Realism places the heaviest premium on the pursuit of power. The 
theory also claims to be ruthlessly objective. Fundamentally, realism 
believes there is a desire for power that motivates the human condition.
 This drive determines the actions of states. The interest in power is 
biological and creates a permanent state of insecurity. Since power is 
relative, the best outcome possible is a balance wherein nobody thinks 
they can get away with aggression.</p>
<p>The world in realism is inherently non-hierarchical. There is no 
actor with power over the states and thus the relations between states 
must but reached through mutual, self-reinforcing agreements rather than
 universal norms of behavior. In this anarchic world, states only abide 
by agreements when it is in their interest to do so. This is most often 
accomplished in reciprocal behavior. That is, states cooperate only in 
so long as they think the other state is reciprocating the behavior. In 
this view, the behavior of a state toward prisoners of war held in its 
territory is only as good as the treatment the enemy provides its own 
prisoners of war. Positive or negative treatment of prisoners of war by 
one party is reciprocated by the other.</p>
<p>States in realism contain two primary characteristics of interest. 
First, they are unitary actors. That is, substate actors have little or 
no influence on the behavior of states. This poses interesting 
theoretical questions regarding prisoners of war since they, by 
definition, are substate actors. The only time negative behavior toward 
prisoners of war changes state behavior is if it affects the realpolitik
 power of the state. Similarly, states represent the primary actors in 
the international system and extra-state actors such as international 
governmental organizations (IGOs) and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) do not influence state behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, the actions of states are driven by the desire for national 
security and survival. States work not to spread their ideology or 
values but to secure themselves in a competitive world through military 
and economic capacity. The obsession with national interest frames 
realism’s view of prisoners of war. Prisoners are kept healthy only so 
long as it is in the national interest to do so. However, when the costs
 of supporting enemy prisoners become greater than the benefits, states 
have little reason to maintain them.</p>
<p>While realism does not directly address prisoners of war, we can draw
 out four predictions. These predictions tell us the kind of information
 which would prove realism was an accurate and useful paradigm through 
which to view the world. Later in the paper we will test these 
predictions against the real world.</p>
<p>First, regime type does not affect state behavior toward prisoners of
 war. The pressures of international competition in realism’s anarchy 
are so large as to drown out any influence offered by variations in 
domestic systems (Morrow 2007, 561). Prisoners of war exist outside the 
realm of domestic politics. Therefore, the values found in the domestic 
political structure do not motivate state behavior toward prisoners of 
war. In realism, brutal autocratic dictators treat prisoners of war the 
same as stable democracies.</p>
<p>Second, state behavior will be unaffected by treaties, IGOs, and 
NGOs. Realism’s assumption that substate and extra-state actors have 
little influence predicts states will comply with treaties, IGOs and NGO
 if and only if they would do so even if those structures did not exist.
 Thus, while a state might comply with an international convention “the 
legal status of the treaty has no real effect on whether they do” and 
the treaty will be violated as soon as the interests of the state 
diverge from that of the treaty (Morrow 2007, 560). Therefore, under 
realism we will observe states ignoring attempts from treaties, IGOs, 
and NGOs to influence state behavior toward prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Third, prisoner of war treaties will focus on enforceable reciprocity
 rather than values. Two assumptions will dictate the contents of 
treaties under realism. First, states will only comply with 
international treaties if they would have behaved the same without the 
treaties. Second, the nature of international cooperation in realism is 
through reciprocity. Following these assumptions, successful treaties 
should focus not on values (cheap talk in realism) but on the 
reciprocal, self-reinforcing arrangements. Treaties codifying these 
reciprocal behaviors will be less likely violated and better appear to 
withstand the test of time.</p>
<p>Fourth, spirals of retaliation will be observable in history. Morrow 
points out that “political institutions must be self-enforcing to be 
sustained. In the language of game theory institutions must form an 
equilibrium of the game…” (Morrow 2001, 973).  Regarding prisoners of 
war in realism, this equilibrium is created through the reciprocal 
behavior between warring states. However, when states are unwilling 
(i.e. not taking prisoners of war) or unable (i.e. lacking the resources
 to treat prisoners well) to reciprocate, the equilibrium becomes 
unbalanced. One outcome of such an unbalance can be a spiral of 
retaliation, wherein a state’s unwillingness or inability to provide 
sufficient care for prisoners of war leads to retaliation against 
prisoners held by its enemy, in turn sparking mutual retaliations from 
both sides. This Axelrod “ALL D” prisoner of war equilibrium should be 
observable in history.</p>
<h2>Prisoners of War in Constructivism</h2>
<p>Realism neglects the world of ideas. Constructivists believe 
international relations is not autonomous to humanity’s structure of 
ideas, values, and norms. To constructivists “norms trump interests 
because norms constitute interests” (Morrow 2007, 560). The material 
power prominent in realism is still important, but the ideas, norms and 
values are just as important. This material world is only impactful when
 it is filtered through agents’ ideas of it. Agents are limited in 
transforming the world to a direction predicated on their thoughts of 
it. It follows then, that researchers cannot explain the structure of 
the material world unless understanding the ideational part behind it.</p>
<p>Constructivism gives two primary reasons why states will enter into 
treaties regarding prisoners of war. These reasons are centered on the 
values the states hold rather than their interests.</p>
<p>First, states are drawn to joining in organizations with like-valued 
states. Hawkins (2004) argues that norms fundamentally lodged in the 
“taken-for-granted beliefs of precedent, international cooperation, and 
prevention of bodily harm” are likely to be adopted by similarly valued 
states (799). Constructivism posits that, at its heart, prisoners of war
 treaties are concerned with the codifying the socialized values of the 
signatory states on the health and well-being of the prisoners under 
their care and under its enemies’ care. Thus, like-valued states will 
join with other states in creating enforceable international agreements 
on the treatment of prisoners of war. This agreement over the prevention
 of bodily harm can be shared even between warring states. States can go
 to war while simultaneously agreeing prisoners of war must be 
protected.</p>
<p>Second, states might join international prisoner of war agreements to
 precommit to socialized norms. Precommitment removes the temptation of 
violating closely held values in the future. The theory, developed by 
Steven Ratner (2004), argues a state can attempt to “restrain oneself 
from doing something that one would otherwise do because such restraint 
will itself directly improve one’s future welfare” (87). During 
peacetime states holding a strong value of protecting prisoners of war 
might fear that under the fog of war there could be the temptation to 
violate those values for some short term benefit. One way to overcome 
this dilemma is to restrain future action by precommitting to the values
 through an enforceable international treaty before presented with such 
temptations.</p>
<p>Paralleling the discussion of realism, we derive four observable 
predictions on prisoners of war from the constructivist paradigm.  These
 represent the information we expect to find if constructivism 
represents an accurate lens through which to view the world.</p>
<p>First, the domestic structure of states will affect behavior toward 
prisoners of war. Specifically, democracies treat prisoners of war 
better relative to non-democracies. Constructivists argue states comply 
with international treaties because they have internalized the values 
and norms underlying such obligations. Since democracies are more open 
than other forms of government to the civil society norm entrepreneurs 
advancing these norms, they are more likely to internalize and comply 
with the norms (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, Morrow 2007).</p>
<p>Second, states largely comply with treaties, IGOs, and NGOs. These 
three institutions represent the primary norm entrepreneurs of 
international civil society and hold, to greater and lesser extents, 
influence over state behavior through positive or negative social 
pressures. Even undemocratic states share certain social values (e.g. 
state legitimacy …) with the international community and these 
socializations can be exploited by extra-governmental actors to further 
their goals regarding prisoners of war. Thus, constructivism predicts 
instances of even autocratic state behavior toward prisoners of war 
being influenced by treaties, IGOs, and NGOs.</p>
<p>Third, treaties will reflect the shared values of the states rather 
than reciprocal behaviors. States enter into international prisoners of 
war treaties because of shared values and norms on their treatment. The 
text of the treaties should focus on the codification of those shared 
norms.</p>
<p>Fourth, states which have internalized the norms toward the treatment
 of prisoners of war will unilaterally comply with those norms even when
 their enemy is unwilling or unable to do so. State behavior toward 
prisoners of war under constructivism is driven by internally held 
values and not external interests. Prisoner of war noncompliance by one 
state will not effect the compliance of their enemy.</p>
<h2>Comparing Realism and Constructivism</h2>
<p><strong>Regime Matters</strong></p>
<p>The table 1 presents the percent of World War II prisoners of war 
which died in captivity by state dyad. Realism predicts no relationship 
between regime type and prisoner of war behavior while constructivism 
predicts democracies will be more humane toward prisoners of war.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/pow-table1.png" alt="POW Table One"></p>
<p>Twenty seven percent of US and Commonwealth prisoners of war held by 
Japan died in captivity. By comparison “relatively few” Japanese 
prisoners of war in held by the US and Commonwealth countries died in 
captivity. Furthermore, four percent and less than one percent of US/ 
Commonwealth and German prisoners of war died in captivity respectively.
 The data supports the constructivism prediction. More democratic states
 (US, Commonwealth countries) systematically treated prisoners of war 
held by them better than less democratic states (Japan, Germany). These 
preliminary results open the possibility that the dynamics of the 
domestic system of states influences their behavior toward prisoners of 
war.</p>
<p><strong>Treaty, IGO, NGO Compliance</strong></p>
<p>Regarding treaty, IGO, NGO compliance, realism predicts states behave
 the same whether or not the treaty exists. Constructivism predicts 
states which internalize the norms of a treaty will follow them.</p>
<p>Some evidence supports the realism predictions. States often wantonly
 disregard the prisoner of war treaties to which they have ascribed. A 
memo by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) written 
during the Iran-Iraq War bemoans:</p>
<blockquote><p> …although the Geneva Conventions confers on those 
prisoners a legal status entitling them to specific rights, the Iranian 
authorities’ continuous delaying tactics since May 1982, the obstacles 
and restrictions they have raised and their refusal to allow the ICRC to
 visit some POW camps have prevented the ICRC from carrying out its work
 for the prisoners whom the Iranian authorities admit they are holding. 
(MERIP 1983, 40)</p></blockquote>
<p>However, this same memo reports that prisoners of war held by Iraq, 
“have been able for the law few months to correspond with their families
 in a satisfactory manner” (MERIP 1984, 40). Therefore the evidence 
suggests the relationship is not so clear cut. The two nondemocratic, 
warring states, which agreed to same treaties, behave differently 
regarding compliance toward the Geneva Conventions and the ICRC. Realism
 provides no explanation. Under realism Iraq has little reason to comply
 with the Geneva Conventions since Iran is clearly not reciprocating. 
Constructivism however does offer an explanation. Ropp and Sikkink 
(1999) note constructivist scholars have theorized that states which 
accept treaties with no intention of complying with them may find the 
obligation changes their identity and thus gives them an incentive for 
compliance. Therefore, while both states agreed to the Geneva 
Conventions we can see that to some extent (i.e. Iraqi behavior), the 
treaties have influenced state behavior.</p>
<p>Another example is the Japanese compliance with the treatment of 
prisoners of war during the Russo-Japanese War and World War II. During 
the former the Japanese “scrupulously fulfilled its obligations to 
Russian and German POWs under the treaties at the time” (Morrow 2001, 
990). However, this behavior changed during World War II wherein the 
“Japanese had switched to neglect of prisoners at best and outright 
abuse of them at worse…” (Morrow 2001, 990). In both cases Japanese 
enemies complied with the treaties throughout the wars.</p>
<p>Under realism’s interest based paradigm, the Japanese had no reason 
to switch from compliance to noncompliance. The national interest 
regarding Japanese prisoners of war did not change. What did change 
however, was the value Japanese society placed on prisoners of war. 
Between the two wars Japan developed a “culture of shame” surrounding 
surrender in battle (Morrow 2001, 990) and this value extended to 
include US and Commonwealth prisoners. Japanese state behavior change 
toward prisoners of war is explained by a shift in values, not in 
interests.</p>
<p><strong>Treaty Contents</strong></p>
<p>Realism predicts treaties will focus on improving reciprocal, 
self-reinforcing relationships. Constructivism predicts treaties will 
focus on the shared socialized values and norms between signatory 
states.</p>
<p>There are some instances of the reciprocal relationships predicted in
 realism. Article 4, Chapter Two of the 1923 treaty between Greece and 
Turkey regarding prisoners of war specifies:</p>
<blockquote><p> …Greece shall restore to Turkey and shall transport to Smyrna simultaneously all the Turkish prisoners of war detained by her.</p>
<p>Turkey shall thereupon restore to Greece an equivalent number of 
Greek prisoners of war, officer for officer, soldier for soldier… The 
remainder of the Greek prisoners of war shall be repatriated by the 
Turkish Government immediately after the signature of peace… (Agreement 
Between Greece and Turkey Respecting the Reciprocal Restitution of 
Interned Civilians and the Exchange of Prisoners of War, 1923)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the treaty, state behavior is driven by reciprocity. That is, 
Turkey transfers its prisoners of war only after Greece reciprocates by 
releasing an equal number of prisoners.</p>
<p>Most major prisoners of war treaties however, deal almost exclusively
 with the fair and responsible treatment of prisoners. These treaties 
follow the constructivist predictions by focusing on the shared values 
states hold. These values range from the use of muzzled dogs to track 
down escaped prisoners to a mandatory day of rest from forced labor on 
the Sabbath (Prisoners of War 1919, 14 -19). These types of clauses 
represent the bulk of prisoners of war treaties and yet are too 
specific, minor, and/or undetectable to be used in reciprocal 
relationships. The signatories must have known ex ante that violations 
to many of these rules would never be uncovered in time to retaliate. 
Therefore, it is fair to conclude that these treaty contents represent 
the socialized shared values between the states.</p>
<p><strong>Retaliations</strong></p>
<p>Realism predicts spirals of retaliation whenever one state is 
unwilling or unable to reciprocate behavior toward prisoners of war. 
Constructivism instead predicts unilateral compliance when the state has
 internalized treaty norms.</p>
<p>There is little doubt retaliation is commonplace is war. Morrow calls
 retaliation “the unstated but recognized tool of enforcement” (2001, 
981). After the Dieppe Raid in 1943 German prisoners of war reportedly 
had their hands tied for a time before being freed, a violation of the 
treaties in place at the time. German infantry soldiers responded to the
 news by binding the hands of Commonwealth soldiers they held in the 
field (Morrow 2001, 981).</p>
<p>However, direct acts of reciprocity occur almost exclusively at the 
tactical level and do not represent official policies of states. William
 O’Brien argues state level retaliation has largely discontinued as an 
accepted practice. He observes that “most forms of reprisal are no 
longer legal under international customary and conventional law; these 
include retaliation in kind against [prisoners of war] for mistreatment 
by the other side, and reprisals against civilians” (1995, 46). If we 
limit retaliation toward prisoners of war to that of the state levels of
 analysis we find support for the predictions of constructivism. That 
is, states which have socialized treaty norms unilaterally comply even 
in the face enemies unwilling or unable to reciprocate.</p>
<p>In 1914, Commander Stone observed:</p>
<blockquote><p> Upon the entry of the United States into the war, our 
government deemed it expedient to utter a pronouncement to the effect 
that while the Government of the United States, for good and sufficient 
reasons, did not consider that the actual provisions of the several 
Conventions of Geneva and the Hague were operative in this war, it did 
consider that the principles underlying the provisions were of force and
 that they would be followed by the United States as a general guide in 
the circumstance. (Stone 1919, 407)</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States, while acknowledging the letter of the treaties was
 not in force, announced publicly that it considered the norms codified 
in the treaties in force and would act accordingly. These actions do not
 reflect reciprocity but a drive to fulfill the socialized identity and 
norms the nation had for itself and its actions.</p>
<p>In the 16th through 18th centuries the concept of “parole” was 
commonplace. Gentlemen and aristocrats captured in battle could be 
released and allowed to return home if they gave their word not to 
rejoin the fighting (Walzer 1969, 779). By World War II this ethic was 
largely abandoned except for one curious and illuminating case. During 
fighting in the Philippines a small group of Americans was captured by 
Japanese infantry, who upon receiving the Americans’ word not to fight, 
paroled and freed them. The US government accepted the paroles of the 
soldiers and deemed parole as legally prohibiting the men from offering 
any support to the US war effort against the Japanese (Walzer 1969, 
780). Realism offers no explanation for the position of the US 
government. Since the probability of developing a reciprocal parole 
system was remote, there was no reason for the US government harm its 
interest by unilaterally abiding by the parole agreement. However, 
constructivism offers an explanation. Honoring the parole was in 
compliance with socialized norms the US had internalized, even when 
doing so was a unilateral action.</p>
<p>The United States is not alone in unilateral compliance with prisoner
 of war agreements. The mission statement of the Israeli Defense Force 
(IDF) refers to the ideal that “IDF soldiers will not use their weapons 
and force to harm human beings who are not combatants or prisoners of 
war” (Sucharov 2005, 182). The ideal is held in such high regard that 
IDF soldiers possess, the option and obligation to disobey blatantly 
illegal orders (Sucharov 2005, 182). This code of conduct makes 
reciprocal retaliation by the Israeli government legally impossible. The
 outlawing of prisoner of war reciprocity defies a realist explanation 
since the threat of retaliation is what the paradigm holds as the 
central tenant of prisoner of war interstate relations. Through a 
constructivist lens however, the actions reveal a state with 
internalized norms of behavior and a desire to follow them even in the 
face of an enemy unwilling or unable to do so.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through a brief overview of prisoners of war in both the realist and 
constructivism paradigms we have found the former wanting. From each of 
the two theories we derived four symmetrical, observable predictions. 
The end result was that time and again realism’s interest based approach
 to international relations failed to offer an explanatory edge over 
constructivism’s value based approach. While this paper does not attempt
 to posit itself as a comprehensive test of the two theories, the 
results do offer weak support that constructivism is better able to 
provide explanatory leverage regarding prisoners of war in the 
Westphalian system. That is, without historicizing and contextualizing 
state behavior through appreciation of their values and norms, theories 
and research on prisoners of war offer less ability to interpret, 
explain, and predict.</p>

<p>The United States has a problem. Despite overwhelming technological 
and military power, the US is rapidly losing the war of public 
perception. Matt Armstrong (aka <a href="http://www.mountainrunner.us/">MountainRunner</a>) succinctly summarizes the situation in a <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/section/Provocations/america_should_hire_al-qaedas_pr_agent">2007 Good Magazine article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> “Iraq has become a stage on which terrorists, 
insurgents, and Coalition forces compete for a global audience. YouTube,
 blogs, and all other forms of citizen media ensure that every GI Joe 
and Jihadi has at least a part in the theater of public opinion. The 
result is a new public diplomacy that insurgents understand, and the 
U.S. State Department doesn’t.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt argues that the US is crippling its war for hearts and minds by 
building high security “Crusader castle” embassies in Baghdad and 
elsewhere. But just how can the United States fight an image war?</p>
<p>One idea is to copy Al-Qaeda’s PR strategy: use social networking 
sites, YouTube, and blogs. The problem with this strategy is that it 
plays to America’s weakness. Al-Qaeda’s decentralized, nimble network of
 members, supporters, followers, and fans is well suited to waging an 
information war on an online battlefield. The United States’ centralized
 structure, on the other hand,seems  too slow and rigid to offer an 
effective PR battle. And, despite continuous cries for improvement, this
 situation does not appear to be changing any time soon. But what if 
there was a way to fight the war of public perception by exploiting US 
strengths.</p>
<p>Nobody can rival the United States in technological prowess and power
 projection capabilities. The ability of the United States to place 
military power anywhere in the globe separates it from all other states 
and certainly from Al-Qaeda. By applying these strengths, America moves 
the war of public perception to a new battlefield where it holds the 
high ground. The SkyFreighter (albeit theoretically) might be one way to
 do this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.millenniumairship.com/millenium_airship_inc.htm">The Sky Freighter</a>,
 if the developer’s promises are to be believed (which is not that easy 
considering they misspell “freighter” on their homepage), offers a 
semi-rigid, amphibious, VTOL hybrid heavy lift aircraft capable of 
carrying 500 tons of cargo 6000 miles. In other words, it is a cross 
between a cargo ship and the Hindenburg.<img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/watertest.jpg" alt="SkyFreighter in Water" align="right"></p>
<p>Put into the right hands, these behemoth airship could fly American 
hospitals to the world’s medically underserved and through that mission,
 be American ambassadors. The US Navy already has a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_US_Navy_Hospital_Ships">hospital ships</a>
 used in humanitarian missions, however the ships are limited to working
 along coastlines or large port cites.  SkyFreighter, however, has the 
ability to target specific communities regardless of their location. 
These craft allow the US to conduct public diplomacy campaigns almost 
anywhere, whether in the Somali bush or the Saudi desert. Poor, rural 
villagers will never be fully sheltered from Al-Qaeda’s PR. But, with a 
fleet of US hospital airships those same villagers would never forget 
that their free cleft-pallet surgery was conducted by an American Navy 
airship doctor. Al-Qaeda has little chance of competing against that.</p>

geographical map with the width of the line depicting the size of the 
army at any given period. The tan line represents the offensive 
campaign, while the black line represents the retreat. The results are 
often cited as brilliant examples of the visual display of statistics. I
 enjoy them for another reason. There are dozens of maps and 
publications describing the weaponry, tactics, and leaders of the two 
campaigns. However, through Minard’s map, we are presented a different 
and rarer vision of war, determined as much by infectious disease and 
injury, as by gun, general, or siege.</p>

<p>Over the last few days the world’s eyes have been fixated on a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE53J0IZ20090422?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews">6.5 square mile area in Northern Sri Lanka</a>.
 This zone, protected by an earthen wall, is the last pocket of LTTE 
resistance. LTTE forces are holding thousands of civilians within the 
zone as human shields. Four days ago government forces beached the wall 
in at least one location and “unleashed the exodus”. Reports indicate 
that tens of thousands of civilians have fled the zone through the 
breach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is 60,000 plus and counting, and we have heard various reports of
 up to 110,000 coming out,” said the U.N. spokesman in Colombo, Gordon 
Weiss. He cautioned the reports were preliminary and not confirmed.</p>
<p>The LTTE has accused the military of fabricating the numbers and of 
capturing people it says are staying by choice. It has ignored all calls
 to free civilians while urging a truce, and on Tuesday vowed no 
surrender despite facing overwhelming firepower.</p>

be civilians escaping the last remaining Tamil Tiger area in

held by Sri Lanka’s Tamil Tigers, signalling that the rebels’ “complete 
defeat” was imminent, President Mahinda Rajapakse said. (Credit: AFP/SRI

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>t is generally accepted in the health 
community that increases in worldwide temperature will raise the global 
burden of disease. However, one paper by Kevin Lafferty in this <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090409/full/news.2009.361.html">month’s issue of the journal Ecology</a>
 counters this consensus. According to Lafferty, climate change might 
make the present territory of some diseases too hot. Thus, climate 
change might <em>both</em> open <em>and</em> close territory to diseases.</p>
<p><!--StartFragment--></p>
<p>Critics of Lafferty’s research argue, amongst other things, that 
climate models predict a rise in minimum temperatures rather than 
maximum temperatures. If this it he case, then diseases might maintain a
 hold in their current territory while expanding to newly warmer areas. 
Furthermore, many high-altitude regions have greater population density 
than warmer regions and thus temperature increases will likely increase 
human exposure to disease.</p>
<p>This dialog has important security implications. If climate change 
increases the global burden of disease, health will be a more pressing 
threat to human security and the political stability of states. States 
in cooler climates, which have been largely immune to tropical diseases 
could face new challenges as health services are overwhelmed and 
eventually lose political legitimacy in the eyes of their citizens.</p>
<p>If Lafferty is wrong, building health capacity will become an 
increasingly important tool in US foreign policy. That is, by making 
states and their militaries more resilient to new health threats, the 
United States can promote the stability of her allies and regions of 
interest.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.afgnso.org/"><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he Afghanistan NGO Safety Office (ANSO)</a> (worst website ever by the way…) differs from many organizations operating in the country in that they <a href="http://easterncampaign.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/anso-q1-2009-data-report2.pdf">have regularly published their data</a>.
 Despite the benefits to openness, many organizations hold onto their 
data with a tight fist. ANSO’s Quarterly Data Report for Q1 2009 offers 
insights into the behavior towards NGOs working in the state. The report
 finds that the number of attacks on NGOs in Q1 2009 increased six 
percent since the <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/KHII-7J78AW?OpenDocument">same period in 2008</a>. The most dangerous provinces are Kandahar, Herat, Kabul and Kunar with four, six, four and four attacks respectively.</p>
<p>As the report points out, the distribution of attacks on NGOs across 
Afghanistan likely has more to do with where humanitarians operate 
rather than variations in the security situation. That is, most of the 
provinces are dangerous for NGOs, and the variation in the number of 
attacks is simply due to the level of NGO presence.</p>
<p>The data on NGO attacks in Afghanistan is further evidence that <a href="http://warandhealth.com/attacking-humanitarians-as-a-strategy/">the neutrality of NGOs is dying</a>, or <a href="http://bloodandmilk.org/?p=1294">never existed in the first place</a>.
 If NGOs are going to operate effectively in Afghanistan and elsewhere, 
they must either do so under the security umbrella of GoA / Western 
forces (which comes with its own set of problems) or make local 
agreements of neutrality with tribal leaders and combatants. The take 
away point: humanitarians cannot rely on international norms of 
neutrality, and perhaps never could.</p>

 Conversely, deadly diseases that have emerged in the world’s oceans

diseases haven’t caused epidemics in humans, they have proved 
troublesome to marine animal populations and to susceptible humans who

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/iraq-health-vehicle.jpg" alt="Iraq Health Vehicle" class="frame"></p>
<p>Health workers in war-torn countries often have the skills and wealth
 to leave their homeland for greener (or at least safer) pastures 
abroad. Iraq is no exception; according to some unverified numbers, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-08-17-medical-exodus_N.htm">half of Iraqi doctors have fled</a> the country since 2003 and those remaining live in constant danger. Their fears are not unfounded. In March 2005, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59240-2005Feb28.html">115 people were killed</a>
 outside an Iraqi health clinic in the city of Hilla. The victims were 
lined up outside the clinic to get medical tests necessary for jobs in 
the Iraqi government. In April, five health workers were kidnapped on 
their way to an IDP camp near Kandahar. After the incident, health 
workers refused to travel to the area until their security could be 
guaranteed. Regarding the kidnapping, Dr. Abdullah Fahim, the Afghan 
Ministry of Health spokesman <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=71821">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the security of our health workers is not ensured, 
then we cannot put more health workers at risk and we won’t be able to 
send more doctors to the camp”</p></blockquote>
<p>In both examples, health workers were either directly or indirectly 
targeted by combatants because of their perceived connection to the 
government. In Iraq, the health workers were (amongst other things) 
screening recruits for the Iraqi security forces. In Afghanistan, the 
health workers were riding in a government vehicle.</p>
<p>To prevent the flight of health workers and preserve indigenous 
health services in conflict zones, a negotiated “health neutrality” must
 be considered. The lack of access to health workers effects both sides 
of a conflict, and thus by banning government health workers from 
directly assisting either side’s military operations (such as screening 
Iraqi Army recruits), their security could be better guaranteed. This 
model is not entirely new. The ICRC has been benefiting from a strict 
neutrality stance for more than a century.</p>
<p>Nobody disputes that the primary function of government health 
workers is to provide their services to all in need. Imposing a “wall” 
between government health ministries and government military operations 
would solidify the notion of the neutrality of health security between 
combatants and guarantee the protection of the health workers 
themselves, thus lowering the rate of “doctor drain”.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> joined <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>
 more than a year ago, but at that time it was largely unknown outside 
tech circles and only a handful of people in the global health, 
security, and international relations communities used the service. This
 has changed in recent months, with Twitter becoming almost mainstream.</p>
<p>If blogs post are the ‘conference papers’ of the internet, then 
Twitter is the small-talk between sessions. Currently, a growing 
community of security, international relations, and global health 
scholars and researchers use Twitter to share and debate ideas. 24 hours
 a day, 7 days a week, this community hums with activity and discussion.
 To help readers of War &amp; Health interested in joining, below are 35
 global health, foreign affairs, and international security scholars,

 is reporting a widespread measles outbreak in Iraq. Insecurity in some 
provinces prevented vaccination programs, enabling the outbreak to 
develop unchecked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Measles were first detected in central Iraq, and is now moving north 
and south. The initial cases were found in Anbar and Salahaddin, and 
then spread to Ninewa and Tamim. Those provinces lacked adequate 
vaccination programs because of the lack of security. The government 
started an emergency response effort in those four areas, which were 
effective in stopping the spread of measles. However shots were not 
given in the rest of the country, which led to the outbreak spreading to
 Basra, Najaf, Dhi Qar, Muthanna, Maysan, Karbala, Diyala, Qadisiyah, 
Babil, Wasit, and the three provinces of Kurdistan.</p>

<p>Despite popular belief to the contrary, the norm of humanitarian 
neutrality has always been tenuous. Elizabeth Willis’ 2008 paper 
provides an excellent summary of the status of the health / humanitarian
 neutrality norm during the Spanish Civil War:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It will be apparent that few if any participants in the aid effort 
were neutral, even in theory, and for some there was no question even of
 non-combatant status. Medical personnel were counted among the 
casualties. Randall Sollenberger, an American doctor who had been 
working at Bury Royal Infirmary near Manchester, decided to ‘pinch’ two 
trucks and go to help when he heard of the battle of Jerama. Because 
there was more scarcity of doctors than of soldiers, he was put under 
arrest to prevent him from going to the front, but he was killed during 
the Brunete offensive when his truck was bombed. The consideration that 
medical work might include caring for enemy soldiers was no protection; 
there are accounts of the Red Cross symbol being targeted, so that its 
use on vehicles was discontinued. Drivers and stretcher-bearers were 
highly vulnerable. Orwell noticed a Belfast Irishman with some training 
in first aid who ‘went to and fro with packets of bandages, binding up 
the wounded men and, of course, being shot at’. Neither were hospitals 
very safe places of refuge, as already indicated. When Guernica was 
bombed and the hospital was hit, 25 children and two nuns were killed.” 
(Willis 2008, 167-168)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War">Spanish Civil War</a>
 ended 70 years ago today. Author George Orwell participated in the 
conflict and was wounded by a sniper’s bullet. During his treatment and 
recovery Orwell spent some days at a hospital in Tarragona. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Homage-Catalonia-George-Orwell/dp/0156421178/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1238604748&amp;sr=11-1">Homage to Catalonia</a>, he describes his time there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The hospital at Tarragona was a very big one and full of wounded 
from all fronts. What wounds one saw there! They had a way of treating 
certain wounds which I suppose was in accordance with the latest medical
 practice, but which was peculiarly horrible to look at. This was to 
leave the wound completely open and unbandaged, but protected from flies
 by a new of mutter-muslin, stretched over wires. Under the muslin you 
woud see the red jelly of a half-healed wound. There was one man wounded
 in the face and throat who had his head inside a sort of spherical 
helmet of butter-muslin; his mouth was closed up and he breathed through
 a little tube that was fixed between his lops. Poor devil, he looked to
 lonely, wandering to and fro, looking at you through his muslin cage 
and unable to speak. I was three or four days at Tarragona.” (Orwell 
1966, 192)</p>

  Although they represent a tiny percentage of the troops who have 
undergone tours of duty – about 100,000 in Iraq and 50,000 in 
Afghanistan – there is concern that the risk of troops taking their own 
lives is increasing.
</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://forums.csis.org/pcrproject/?p=901">Greg Sanders on the impact of air strikes on Afghan public opinion</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>
  Such deaths have both a human and a political toll. At a recent CSIS 
event, ABC Director of Polling, Gary Langer, described their impact on 
popular support for the coalition. The ABC/BBC/ARD poll found that local
 experience with U.S. bombing and artillery fire was strongly correlated
 with both negative attitudes towards the U.S., towards the Afghan 
central and provincial governments, and regarding Afghanistan’s 
direction. This dissatisfaction can lead to radicalization: some 44 
percent of Afghans who experienced local bombing believe that attacks 
against coalition forces could be justified.

  I didn’t realize that 40,000 Koreans who were in Japan were killed in

<blockquote><p>
  We often hear that life is precious. But how precious? Can we really 
try to ascribe cold monetary values to a warm life? When you don’t 
consciously estimate, you run the risk of underestimating it. Every 
living moment we take chances: it’s unsafe to eat, it’s unsafe to work, 
it’s unsafe to drive. And whenever we trade risk of death off for time 
or money, we reveal the value we ascribe to our own life. And with this,
 we can also contemplate about the cost of economic disasters, and 
measure them in human life.

<p>War &amp; Health is charged with examining the connection between 
armed conflict and health. The majority of the time this takes the form 
of quantitative analysis of the available data. Diseases and wars 
reduced to values on a spreadsheet. I believe in this approach. However,
 far too common, I think, researchers forget that the observations we 
conduct in our statistical symphonies are all events of complexity and 
often, devastation.</p>
<p>The data is clear, IED attacks in Iraq are declining. The slope is 
negative. But, these are not mere points on a scatterplots, or 
observations in our regressions. They are tragedies of the human 
condition. Each deadly attack, each “N”, is a family’s tragedy.</p>

<p>And, in the end, the accuracy of our findings is not for conference 
papers or publications, but to give their tragedies some meaning.</p>
<p>Journalist <a href="http://www.adn.es/blog/en_pie_de_guerra/">David Beriain</a> offers a good reminder that the N’s in the IED data are always more than numbers:</p>

<p>This week I review an article by David Fidler of Indiana’s School of Law addressing the <a href="http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/ecomm/files/040205Fidler.pdf">growing nexus between health and foreign policy (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, health has been categorized as a field of “low 
politics”, while national security is the realm of “high politics”. 
Under this perspective, health is a goal of normative humanitarianism 
and not a significant component in international security. Fidler 
demonstrates this point with the simple example of biological weapons. 
When biological weapons have been addressed by the international 
community, they have done so under the guise of arms control (high 
politics) rather than health (low politics). However, the position of 
health in the hierarchy of politics is changing.</p>
<p>Fidler posits health’s increasing importance, particularly in the 
Carter and Bush (II) administrations, and summarizes three 
conceptualizations of its role in foreign affairs.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution –</strong> Health “collapses” high and low 
politics into a new paradigm where “health serves as a central objective
 of global policy” (Fidler 2005, 7). That is, health changes everything.</p>
<p><strong>Remediation –</strong> This conceptualization argues that 
while health is no longer in the realm of “low politics”, it has become 
just another issue addressed by traditional foreign policy. Health’s 
role in “high politics” is furthermore limited to those diseases capable
 of disrupting the material, security, and power capabilities of states.</p>
<p><strong>Regression –</strong> The regression conceptualization argues
 that health’s growing importance is a side effect of the worsening 
global health situation. As emerging and reemerging diseases threaten 
the population of states, the “conventional perspectives of health in 
foreign policy hold health hostage to the views of powerful states 
concerning their material interests and capabilities”. (Fidler 2005, 9).
 As a result, the regression conceptualization posits that health’s new 
connection to high politics has been done so without the normative goals
 traditionally associated with international health.</p>
<p>Regardless of their differences, Fidler argues that all the 
conceptualizations see health’s relationship with foreign policy as a 
“radical break” from the past, bringing up new challenges for the 
international community. Specifically, health is quickly becoming a key 
indicator of good governance at the domestic and international levels. 
That is, a population’s health is becoming a fundamental measure of the 
legitimacy of their governing political bodies.</p>

<p>When you research and write about the intersection of diseases and 
armed conflict, there are relatively few opportunities to discuss the 
lighter side of things. So for this reason, I was pleased to see that 
scientists that worked on the Star Wars missile defense shield are <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123680870885500701.html">developing a laser weapon system to kill mosquitos</a>. Even better, the scientists want to mount these lasers on unmanned airborne drones, creating what could best be described as <em>mosquito hunter-killer flying robots that shoot lasers… of awesomeness</em>.</p>
<p>I am all for diversity of approaches, but this seems a little 
ridiculous. Never in my discussions with malaria experts has the idea 
for laser shooting robots come up. Now, you could chalk it up to a lack 
of imagination on their part, but I suspect my colleagues would 
disagree. It is one thing to think outside the box, it is another to 
augment the box with wings, lasers guns and a computer brain.</p>
<p>I, for one, welcome our new flying laser shooting mosquito robot overlords.</p>

<p>Do any significant work on the DoD’s role in public health and the 
name “Gail Fisher” inevitably comes up. US Army Major Fisher, who holds a
 MPH and a MA in journalism, is (for my money) the Pentagon’s leading 
expert on the relationship between the military, public health, and 
health diplomacy. Gail knows it all. In January, unbeknownst to me, Gail
 launched <a href="http://mendstate.blogspot.com/">Mendstate</a>, a blog
 on health’s relationship to defense, diplomacy, and development. Each 
of Gail’s posts is a ~500 word, fantastically written missive on the 
DoD’s role in health and health diplomacy. The take away point: <em>If you read War &amp; Health, you should be reading her blog too.</em></p>
<p>Below are links to three of Gail’s posts and short teasers.</p>
<h3><a href="http://mendstate.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-legitimacy.html">On Legitimacy</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Working with the Minister of Public Health in Afghanistan to build 
the health system is admirable work, but is it legitimizing the 
government? Does it de-ligitimize the coalition efforts to be involved? 
Should only NGOs do this work? All these questions depend upon the 
cultural ideation of legitimacy and health institutions, I think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://mendstate.blogspot.com/2009/01/defense-diplomacy-and-development.html">Defense, Diplomacy and Development: A Gordian Knot?</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming that we feel it somehow a basic and shared human value 
(Condoleeza Rice has said something to this effect) that all people 
should get health care everywhere and that by extension, we should try 
to work toward that end, we must act with caution since apparently there
 is no recognizably effective method of acting. The Western world often 
feels that it has a moral imperative to assist with saving lives where 
ever and whenever it can. But does that life saved cause another life 
lost elsewhere?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://mendstate.blogspot.com/2009/01/militarizing-health-or-health-erizing.html">Militarizing health? Or “health-erizing” the military?</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, perhaps its time that the other agencies help DoD 
understand that it has a talent. That helping peoples in other lands 
develop their public health systems might sometimes be an appropriate 
use of DoD resources, and an activity that will create healthier 
populations abroad and at home, legitimize governments, boost economies 
and hopefully give a good impression of America. It’s not an either-or 
world: that there is still enough world for both USAID and DoD and the 
Dept of State to do good. Instead of complaining, why not grab the bull 
by the horns and give it a little shake? I can only hope that the 
incoming political appointees will reach out and grab ahold.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Guinea-Bissau <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-03-10-voa36.cfm">buried its former President, Joao Bernardo Vieira</a>.
 Mr. Vieira was assassinated a week ago by army soldiers, likely in 
reprisal for the murder of the nation’s top military leader only hours 
before. The double killings have increased fears that the small African 
nation will fall back into internal strife, even civil war. What would 
be the health consequences of a new civil war? The answer lies in 
history.</p>
<p>Reader Stephen Murphy has completed extensive research on the country
 and recently sent me a copy of his unpublished 2007 paper on the health
 effects of Guinea-Bissau’s 1998-1999 civil war. He has graciously given
 War &amp; Health permission to publish the paper. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Public Health Consequences and Responses in Civil War: Lessons from Epidemiology Research in Guinea-Bissau</h3>
<p><strong>Stephen J. Murphy</strong><br>
December 19, 2007<br>

<p>By examining how civil wars affect civilian populations in a manner 
that goes beyond merely calculating numbers of violent deaths and 
displaced people, humanitarian aid practitioners can discern practical 
lessons for mitigating the health impacts of complex emergencies. 
Studies produced by the Bandim Health Project during the 1998-1999 civil
 war in Guinea-Bissau provide a unique opportunity to develop a more 
nuanced understanding of the consequences of war on the health of a 
population in a least developed country (LDC).</p>
<p>The Bandim Health Project (BHP), an epidemiological research 
institute, has conducted demographic surveillance since 1978 in four 
neighborhoods that include over 15% of the population of the capital of 
Guinea-Bissau. The BHP’s studies related to its own humanitarian 
interventions and those of other actors during the civil war provide 
insights that could inform future efforts to reduce disease and 
mortality in complex emergencies. In this analysis of the BHP war 
studies, I will examine the diseases and risk factors that contributed 
to high mortality rates during the war and propose recommendations from 
the research that could be applied to humanitarian practice in similar 
contexts.</p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau is an ethnically diverse nation of 1.5 million people 
located between Senegal and Guinea. The citizens of Guinea-Bissau have 
struggled with chronic poverty and poor health since the country won 
independence from Portugal in 1974. Most people in rural areas grow rice
 for consumption and cashews as a cash crop, while many citizens in 
Bissau, the capital of approximately 350,000 people, work as traders in 
the informal sector. Guinea-Bissau consistently ranks near the bottom of
 the UN Human Development Index, and the country’s citizens have a life 
expectancy of only 46 years. More than a third of the children under 
five suffer from malnutrition, which also significantly contributes to 
the high infant mortality rate of 130 per 1,000 live births. In some 
rural areas, only a third of the population has access to health 
services, and in the capital, the hospitals and clinics are severely 
overburdened. Malaria is the most severe cause of illness and death 
among children under five, and significant segments of the population 
also suffer from TB and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Weak governance institutions and corruption have undermined 
development in Guinea-Bissau throughout the post-colonial era and 
fostered the political instability that led to the 1998-1999 civil war. 
The World Bank summarizes the general causes of the war as “failed 
governance, breakdown of rule of law, and limited accountability and 
transparency of public sector management.” The immediate cause of the 
unrest, which lasted from June 1998 to May 1999, was President “Nino” 
Viera’s sacking of the leader of the military, Ansoumané Mané, after 
accusing him of selling arms to the Casamance rebels in Senegal. Mané 
then led the army in revolt against President Viera, who received 
immediate military support from Senegal and Guinea. During the course of
 the war, two-thirds of the military and the majority of the population 
backed Mané. With widespread support, Mané and his troops drove Viera 
into exile and the Senegalese and Guinean troops out of Guinea-Bissau.</p>
<p>In his analysis of rural civil society in Guinea-Bissau, the 
anthropologist Joshua Forrest argues that the predominantly rural 
communities of Guinea-Bissau have effectively resisted the control of 
the central government during both Portuguese rule and after 
independence. Forrest characterizes the 1998-1999 war not as a civil 
conflict between ethnic or geographic factions in a divided nation, but 
as a national struggle by the military and the population against an 
ineffective and corrupt government. He claims that Mané’s successful 
revolt resulted in “another victory for rural civil society,” but 
considering the loss of life and increased mortality due to disease, the
 outcome was a pyrrhic victory at best for the people of Guinea-Bissau. 
During the course of the year-long war, health facilities, schools, and 
businesses were destroyed, between 2,000 and 6,000 people were killed, 
and approximately 350,000 citizens, mostly residents of Bissau, became 
internally displaced persons (IDPs). Since most of the fighting took 
place in the capital, IDPs moved in with family, friends, and even 
strangers in surrounding areas; however, they did not congregate in IDP 
camps. Many residents returned to Bissau after the heavy fighting of the
 first few months of the war and then fled again for shorter periods of 
time during increases in violence.</p>
<p>The people of Guinea-Bissau received little external aid during the 
crisis. This was partially due to the country’s lack of geo-political 
significance to donors, the fact that there were few external refugees, 
and that IDP camps were not necessary. During the war, the Ministry of 
Health headed a national committee to coordinate the work of 
humanitarian aid partners, which included the BHP, ICRC, WFP, local 
NGOs, and Catholic missionaries. Little research has been published on 
the humanitarian response to the war in Guinea-Bissau; however, the 
BHP’s epidemiology studies present significant information regarding the
 toll on public health and the effectiveness of interventions in 
reducing illness, malnutrition, and mortality. In addition to conducting
 its regular health surveillance research during the war, the BHP 
distributed food and medicine to IDPs and the families that hosted them 
near Bissau. As IDPs returned to Bissau, the BHP also provided them with
 other forms of aid, including supplementary feeding for malnourished 
children, vitamin A supplementation, and treated bednets for pregnant 
mothers.</p>
<p>Based on their epidemiological surveillance data, the BHP conducted 
studies on a variety of diseases and interventions during the war, and 
its research examining mortality rates, breastfeeding, IDP and host 
family nutrition, and TB treatment reveal critical findings about 
factors that influence the spread of disease and the effectiveness of 
relief efforts during wartime. In their study of mortality patterns, 
Nielsen et al compared mortality rates in BHP’s surveillance zone during
 the war with those of the previous three years to estimate the excess 
mortality due to war. To account for the indirect health consequences of
 war, the researchers separated deaths related to direct acts of war. 
Unlike most mortality studies of war-related emergencies that focus on 
refugees or IDPs isolated in camps far from the frontlines, the authors 
studied a population while it was displaced near the central conflict 
zone. Nielsen at al found that the overall crude mortality rate (CMR) 
rose 78% for the first six months of the war (June-November 1998) when 
IDPs fled the capital to surrounding areas, but the CMR dropped to a 
normal level during the final six months of the war when most IDPs had 
returned to their homes. The crude mortality rate for children under 
five (CMRU5) increased about 100% over the normal expected rate during 
the first six months of the war. From December 1998 to November 1999, 
CMRU5 showed a 40% increase above normal, and during the final three 
months of the conflict, the researchers measured a 20% increase in child
 mortality. Nielsen and his colleagues attribute the less severe excess 
mortality in the second half of the war to “reduced crowding and 
improved hygiene when people returned to their normal homes.” Therefore,
 humanitarian actors may decrease the spread of disease and associated 
mortality by facilitating the return of IDPs to their homes as soon as 
possible during a complex emergency. However, the BHP study also notes 
that the goal of quick re-settlement must be balanced with the security 
situation in the home communities. Interestingly, a related BHP study 
found that child mortality in the pediatric hospital in Bissau actually 
decreased dramatically due to a number of factors associated with the 
war and humanitarian response. Sodemann et al principally attribute the 
drop in mortality among hospitalized children to the increase in aid 
that the hospital received during the war from BHP and other actors. Aid
 agencies distributed essential drugs (which were normally not 
available) free of charge and ensured that the blood bank functioned 
properly. They also reduced incentives for the staff to charge for care 
by providing the health care workers with food each day.</p>
<p>The BHP study on breastfeeding during the civil war in Guinea-Bissau 
reveals how a commonly recommended practice can have profound affects on
 protecting the health of infants in a complex humanitarian emergency 
(CHE). Focusing on the first three months of the year-long war, Jakobsen
 et al compared mortality rates of breastfed children between the ages 
of 9 to 20 months with weaned children of the same age. The researchers 
determined that the mortality rate for the weaned children was six times
 that of the breastfed children; however, prior to the war, their was 
little difference in mortality levels among breastfed and weaned 
children. The increase in mortality for weaned children is “most likely 
because of higher infection pressure during the war when people lived in
 overcrowded houses in the rural area with less access to care.” 
According to Jakobsen at al, diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, and
 malnutrition frequently cause death in CHEs and breastfeeding is 
believed to help prevent or mitigate the severity of each of these 
conditions. The BHP study concludes that “in emergency situations with 
increased risk of infections, maintaining breastfeeding is even more 
critical than under normal conditions.” Moreover, the researchers 
identify weaned children under 21 months as a particular risk group that
 humanitarian actors should focus on during relief efforts.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of war in June 1998, fighting around the northern 
perimeter of the city forced many of the residents to flee south to the 
Prabis peninsula. About 50,000 IDPs moved in with the 7,000 residents 
that lived in the area. Since the WFP initially evacuated from the 
Bissau area, the ICRC and BHP distributed the WFP’s stored rice on the 
peninsula during the first three months of the war before most IDPs 
returned to their homes in the capital. The ICRC followed the WFP’s 
regulation of only distributing food to IDPs, but the BHP later started 
to distribute rice to both IDPs and residents. The BHP studied nutrition
 and mortality among IDP and resident children between the ages of 9-23 
months and discovered that children from both groups had a significantly
 higher mortality rate during the first three months of the war when the
 IDPs lived in Prabis. Aaby et al assert that “with the extreme crowding
 and unhygienic conditions that existed…in Prabis, it is not surprising 
that mortality was much higher for both residents and refugees.” The 
researchers found that the effects of crowding and disease were more 
profound on the health of children than nutrition, and they advocate for
 health care to be offered alongside food aid in emergencies. Moreover, 
the study reveals that resident children on the peninsula suffered a 
mortality rate 4.5% times higher than that of the IDP children. This 
discovery provides evidence that humanitarian agencies must also 
consider the needs of households that host IDPs in non-camp emergency 
settings. In a study of the WFP’s food aid distribution, Hjalte Tin 
criticizes the WFP for its slow response and inappropriate food aid 
targeting practices. Supporting Aaby’s conclusions, Tin argues that 
humanitarian aid agencies should treat families that host IDPs as a “new
 class of vulnerable persons” in complex emergencies.</p>
<p>Although hospitals in Bissau received essential drugs during the war 
channeled through the BHP and other aid agencies, the conflict disrupted
 the supply of TB treatment drugs. The storage facility housing the TB 
drugs was bombed, and the only TB treatment program was moved to a 
suburb five kilometers outside of the capital due to fighting. Utilizing
 the BHP surveillance data of TB patients, Gustafson et al conducted a 
study of the effects of disrupted treatment by comparing mortality rates
 of a cohort of patients who received treatment a year before the war 
(the “peace cohort”) with a cohort of patients whose treatment was 
interrupted during the war (the “war cohort”). During the first four 
months of treatment in Guinea-Bissau, TB patients must visit a treatment
 center on a daily basis to receive directly observed therapy (DOT). 
During the second four-month phase, patients only take drugs every two 
weeks. Comparing patients undergoing the initial phase of daily DOT from
 both cohorts, the BHP study reveals that the mortality rate for those 
with interrupted treatment was three times higher than for those who 
received uninterrupted treatment. The researchers did not discern a 
difference in mortality rates among patients in the second four-month 
phase of treatment. In their discussion of the increased mortality, 
Gustafson et al posit that TB patients “may have been particularly 
vulnerable to stress and infection in the crowded environment” during 
the war. The researchers also found that HIV-positive TB patients whose 
treatment was interrupted were eight times more likely to die than 
HIV-positive patients from the peace cohort. This discovery underscores 
the vulnerability of those living with HIV/AIDS during CHEs. Based on 
the BHP study, it is clear that public health officials and humanitarian
 agencies must develop contingency plans for TB treatment during CHEs, 
and supplying TB patients, especially those with HIV/AIDS, with drugs 
should be a priority. Gustafson et al also discuss how the DOT mechanism
 in Guinea-Bissau does not allow patients to possess more than one dose 
at a time. Given the potential disruptions to daily treatment, health 
care providers should have the flexibility to modify DOT regimens during
 complex emergencies.</p>
<p>The BHP epidemiology studies of the 1998-1999 civil conflict not only
 examine the health consequences of war beyond casualty figures, but 
they also highlight new vulnerable groups and recommendations to 
consider for improving future humanitarian action. The BHP studies 
provide especially useful evidence regarding the health of both IDPs and
 resident civilians in non-camp settings. As the BHP analysis of 
nutrition and mortality in Prabis shows, aid agencies must adapt to the 
coping mechanisms and cultural patterns of IDPs and local populations 
when providing aid rather than enforcing bureaucratic regulations that 
may be counterproductive and result in harm. Throughout the studies, a 
common theme emerges regarding crowding as a facilitator of disease 
transmission in emergencies. The BHP provides a sound public health 
basis for encouraging the re-settlement of concentrated IDPs and 
refugees as soon as possible. In identifying weaned infants, resident 
children in non-camp settings, and TB patients in the initial stage of 
treatment as vulnerable groups, the BHP researchers have also presented 
information that could potentially improve humanitarian aid in other 
contexts.</p>
<p>While the BHP’s research provides ample epidemiological evidence for 
modifying humanitarian interventions, it does not seem to have had a 
recorded impact on humanitarian practice. With the exception of Hjalte 
Tin’s study of WFP food aid policy during the civil war, the available 
academic literature does not address the application of lessons learned 
from the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. Student researchers working with the 
BHP have written theses examining the role of culture and coping 
mechanisms during the war, bet these remain unpublished. Although the 
BHP is a research institute generally engaged in epidemiological studies
 rather than humanitarian interventions, the humanitarian aid community 
could greatly benefit from a broader dissemination of the BHP’s findings
 regarding the health consequences and responses from the war period. An
 opportunity to inform humanitarian practice, particularly in non-camp 
emergency settings, has not yet been realized. One way to potentially 
bridge the gap between the BHP’s war research and future practice could 
be through an effective program evaluation. A thorough evaluation of the
 relief efforts of the BHP and other aid agencies could provide 
comprehensive evidence regarding which practices and policies were most 
effective at reducing disease, malnutrition, and mortality during the 
civil war. An evaluation could not only present findings to inform 
relief and development efforts in Guinea-Bissau, but could also produce 
an easily disseminated publication to be shared widely with the 
humanitarian aid community to impact policies and practices in other 
CHEs. The BHP and its donors should actively identity ways of sharing 
the findings of their wartime epidemiological studies with humanitarian 
and development practitioners. Moreover, humanitarian donors should 
prioritize evaluations of the interventions that they fund to facilitate
 learning that can impact humanitarian practice more broadly.</p>

<p>Last week, the Washington Post published an op-ed by General Merill A. McPeak and Kurt Bassuener <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/04/AR2009030403022.html">arguing that President Obama should establish a no-fly zone over Darfur</a>. The idea has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6178209.stm">proposed before</a>,
 but was repeatedly shot down (pardon the pun) by humanitarian groups 
who (rightly) feared reprisals from the Sudanese government. However, 
the objections will be less vocal now that Bashir has booted 13 aid 
groups from Sudan after the International Criminal Court issued an 
arrest warrant against him. Bashir also <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7851886.stm">reportedly</a> launched more air attacks. McPeak and Bassuener argue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Air power plays a central role in Bashir’s military strategy, so 
establishing a no-fly zone remains the most promising initiative to halt
 the atrocities in Darfur. During her Senate confirmation hearing, 
Hillary Clinton acknowledged that such a proposal was under 
consideration. As a practical matter, imposing control over Sudanese 
airspace must involve NATO and European Union allies, in particular 
France, which has a suitable airfield at Abeche, in eastern Chad. Allied
 air forces could and should provide much of the force structure, 
principally fighter aircraft, but a U.S. contribution — especially of 
aerial refuelers and command-and-control aircraft — would be essential. 
About a squadron of each type of aircraft would be more than enough to 
end the impunity Sudanese military aviation now enjoys.</p>
<p>By taking away the Sudanese government’s freedom to use air power to 
terrorize its population, the West would finally get enough leverage 
with Khartoum to negotiate the entry of a stronger U.N. ground force. 
Effective military action in the form of a no-fly zone would not 
preclude a political resolution, as some suggest, but in fact would make
 diplomacy more effective by reducing Bashir’s options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McPeak and Bassuener’s proposal is appealing, but the devil is in the
 details. After the 1991 Gulf War, the ceasefire agreement required that
 Iraq not deploy aircraft in the country. However, General Swartzkoff 
limited the restriction to fixed-wing aircraft. Simply put, Iraq could 
legally use attack helicopters, and they did just that. Even after a 
true no-fly zone was established (banning both fixed and rotary wing 
aircraft), civilians continued to suffer. In 1994 and 1996 State 
Department annual reports on human rights in Iraq admitted that the 
no-fly zones did little to protect civilians. Saddam simply switched 
from helicopter gunship to artillery bombardment (amongst other things).</p>
<p>I am always skeptical at using violence to stop violence. I agreed 
when aid groups opposed a no-fly zone over Darfur. Who else would know 
better what the region needs? But now Bashir has made the purely 
humanitarian option impossible. The US Air Force has been trying for 
years to justify their expensive toys which have played only token roles
 in Iraq and Afghanistan. I say give them Darfur’s sky.</p>

<p>As the domain of security enlarged to incorporate new threats and 
actors, it increasingly overlapped with the field of development. The 
threats from poverty, environmental scarcity, famine, infectious disease
 and others began to be explored in both development and security 
communities. The growing intersection between the two was captured under
 the concept of human security. Broadly, human security formalized the 
belief that security studies should “shift from the state to the 
individual and should encompass military as well as nonmilitary threats”
 (King and Murray 2001-2002, 588-589).</p>
<p>The concept of human security first received widespread attention in 
1994 when it appeared in the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) 
Human Development Report (HDR). While, as Axworthy (2001) points out, 
the idea that populations have certain security concerns and rights is 
old, the HDR was the first major attempt to push the concept into the 
mainstream development, foreign policy, and security communities. Under 
the UN’s definition, human security constitutes seven dimensions: 
economic, food, health, environmental, personal, political, and 
community security. This broad definition addressed many of the main 
concerns of vulnerable populations, but also made operationalizing the 
term troublesome for two reasons. First, the expansive domain covered by
 HDR’s human security could offer little information on how the seven 
dimensions should be prioritized (Axworthy 2001). Should governments, 
international organizations (IGOs), and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) focus their limited resources on public health, peace-building, 
or economic development? Is infectious diseases or income inequality a 
greater threat to human security? Paris argues the vague and expansive 
definition of human security was encouraged by some parties, who found 
it a convenient avenue to argue their area of focus (health, 
environment, culture etc…) constituted a threat to the security of 
individuals and deserved greater mainstream attention (Paris 2001). This
 definition of human was security was “slippery by design” (Paris 2001, 
88).</p>
<p>Second, the imprecision of HDR’s definition made research into the 
human security of populations difficult. Allowing human security to 
include a set of vague dimensions, often with overlapping areas of 
concern, limited the ability to measure and study concepts in order to 
make policy recommendations. Under this definition “virtually any kind 
of unexpected or irregular discomfort could conceivably constitute a 
threat on one’s human security” (Paris 2001, 89).</p>
<p>King and Murray highlighted the imprecision of HDR’s definition 
through a series of off-the-record interviews with politicians and 
government officials. The two authors found almost universal concern 
“that there existed no widely accepted or coherent definition of human 
security” (2001-2002, 591-592).</p>
<p>While sharing the concerns of other scholars regarding the HDR’s 
definition, King and Murray develop a similar but operationalized 
concept. The authors propose that human security can be thought of as 
“generalized poverty”. In their framework, individuals experience 
generalized poverty anytime they fall below some established threshold 
in a central aspect of “human well-being” (King and Murray 2001-2002, 
585). In this way, human security addresses only the more at-risk 
individuals who fall below some acceptable minimum standard in a vital 
area. For example, a family could be considered impoverished if their 
daily caloric intake is less than the recommended minimum. The central 
appeal of King and Murray’s definition is measurability. With the proper
 data and a set of thresholds for each domain of well being, it is 
theoretically possible to construct a quantitative index of human 
security. For this purpose King and Murray propose a measure they call 
Years of Individual Human Security (YIHS) defined as “the expect number 
of years of life spent outside the state of generalized poverty” (King 
and Murray 2001-2002, 595). The disadvantage of this approach is the 
King and Murray’s concept of well-being suffers from the same problems 
of broadness as the HDR. The authors propose including “those domains of
 well-being that have been important enough for human beings to fight 
over or to put their lives or property at great risk” (King and Murray 
2001-2002, 593). However, it is unclear what each of these domains are 
and how they can be measured. The selection and number of the domains 
would have a significant effect on the outcome level of marginal 
poverty.</p>
<p>Mary Kaldor’s (2007) monograph offers another conceptualization of 
human security. Kaldor posits a new definition of security that “is 
about confronting extreme vulnerability not only in wars but in natural 
and man-made disasters…” (Kaldor 2007, 183) and a new definition of 
development that goes beyond improving standards of living to include 
“feeling safe on the streets or being able to influence political 
decision-making” (Kaldor 2007, 183). Based on these new definitions, she
 proposes five principles of human security. First, human security 
places human rights above all else. Second, the local population must 
consider a state’s political institutions legitimate. Third, human 
security operations must 1) work with international organizations, 2) 
create and enforce common rules, and 3) focus on coordination. Fourth, 
human security approaches must be bottom-up and decisions must be made 
in coordination with the local population. Finally, modern conflict does
 not follow borders thus they must be examined at the regional, rather 
than the state level. While on impressive contribution, for empirical 
researchers Kaldor’s approaches offer little advantage over the 1994 
HDR’s definition. It is unclear how Kaldor’s human security could be 
operationalized, since it covers three levels of analysis: states, 
conflicts, and operations. Furthermore, the approach is simultaneously a
 set of threats to be addressed and ideals to be achieved.</p>
<p>Finally, Roland Paris (2001) argues that attempts to define human 
security suffer from an inability to separate causes and effect. 
Specifically, because human security has been defined so broadly, 
incorporating violence, famine, poverty, social marginalization, 
ill-health, and others it is impossible to identify a causal 
relationship between any socioeconomic factor and human security (Paris 
2001, 93). Instead, Paris proposes a definition of human security as a 
category of security research “concerned with military and nonmilitary 
threats-or both to the security of societies, groups, and individuals” 
(Paris 2001, 100).</p>

<p>In the future battlefield medicine could be conducted by robots, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4940737/Robots-could-replace-army-medics-in-battle.html">according to a Telegraph story</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A prototype already undergoing trials contains a three-armed remotely
 controlled robotic surgeon – the equivalent of Benjamin “Hawkeye” 
Pierce, played by Alan Alder in the M*A*S*H series.</p>
<p>The surgical robot is assisted by 12 other robotic systems, including
 a voice-activated “Hot Lips”, the nickname given to chief nurse Major 
Margaret Houlihan in M*A*S*H.</p>
<p>Its single arm passes instruments to the robot surgeon and disposes of used equipment.</p>
<p>A third “circulating nurse” robot has the job of dispensing the right
 tools, while the Pod’s bed monitors vital signs and administers fluids 
and oxygen.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Trauma Pod is to provide a swift “temporary fix” 
to soldiers wounded in battle before they can be transferred to 
hospital.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In emergency medicine, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_%28medicine%29">golden hour</a>
 is the time from the point of injury to a few hours (not a strict hour)
 afterward. Victims receiving treatment in the golden hour have the 
greatest chance of survival. The vast majority of military medical 
advances have attempted to either get victims treatment within the 
golden hour (medivac helicopters, forward field hospitals, etc…) or 
extend the golden hour. The trauma pod is a good example of the former. 
Let’s hope it works.</p>

<p>Freelance journalist <a href="http://warisboring.com/">David Axe</a> is leaving for West Africa <a href="http://warisboring.com/?p=1753">soon to report on the humanitarian diplomacy / soft-power mission of the USS Nashville</a>. If the <a href="http://warandhealth.com/navy-the-new-media/">USS Kearsarge</a>
 is any evidence, David will likely be the only reporter (or blogger) 
doing sustained reporting onboard the Nashville (as opposed to most 
reporters that will pop in and out for a quick story). He is asking for 
donations to help fund his trip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasingly, my reporting is reader-funded. With the accelerating 
decline of traditional print media, this “crowdfunding” model for 
specialist journalism might become the rule rather than the exception. 
My readers donated $1,500 to send me to Chad last summer and another 
$1,000 to support me while working in Kenya in December. You also gave 
$170 to help out Mohamed Omar Hussein, my associate and source in 
Mogadishu. So far, you’ve donated $900 to send me to Nigeria, and for 
that, I am extremely grateful.</p>
<p>That $900 goes a long way towards covering the approximately $5,000 I
 will spend on this enterprise. It’s still a money-losing venture for me
 — my assignments so far are worth just $2,000 — but every dollar 
donated reduces my risk. Hopefully I’ll eventually get enough 
assignments to break even.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David and I shared a suite on the <a href="http://warandhealth.com/war-health-is-setting-sail-aboard-the-uss-kearsarge/">USS Kearsarge</a>. Here are a few things you should know about David if you are considering donating.</p>
<p><strong>First, David has the worst financial strategy towards earning a living I have ever seen.</strong>
 David fronts the cost for his trips out of his pocket, on the hope of 
breaking even from paid reporting jobs later on. He certainly does not 
do these trips for the money (he could earn more at Burger King). I’d 
bet his career in journalism probably has cost him money overall, but he
 does not care. David has a fanatical passion for getting the story out.</p>
<p><strong>Second, David’s loyalty is to the story, and nothing else.</strong>
 He certainly is not a military-fanboy. On the Kearsarge, David used 
every angle, method, and source to get the story. He was aggressive in 
getting what he needed to put out an unbiased story.</p>
<p><strong>Third, David has a <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/08/meet-kearsarge.html">history</a> of <a href="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/article.aspx?id=3312">writing</a> about the relationship between the military and global health.</strong>
 The photo above is David doing a video tour of the USS Kearsarge’s 
massive hospital deck. Furthermore, David has agreed to do some 
reporting on the health aspects of the mission specifically for readers 
of this blog.</p>
<p>So, if you want to support solid, independent reporting and would like to see stories on the medical aspect of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nashville_%28LPD-13%29">USS Nashville</a>’s mission, please <a href="http://warisboring.com/?page_id=1060">send David a few bucks</a>.</p>

<p>I realized today that I had not announced a winner to the <a href="http://warandhealth.com/win-a-free-copy-of-threats-in-the-age-of-obama/">contest from last week!</a> Let me quickly rectify that.</p>
<p>We had <strike>many</strike> a select group of entries, but without further ado, the winner is: <a href="http://hiddenunities.wordpress.com/">Eddie!</a></p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://hiddenunities.wordpress.com/">Eddie’s</a> entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typical armed conflict is septic shock for public health with lethal 
costs in status, efficiency, scope and quality. Recovery is lengthy, 
complicated and can fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I loved his entry. So much of my time is spent between the two fields
 of health and security, that crossover descriptions like his hit a 
strong cord with me. For winning, he will receive a free paper copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Threats-Age-Obama-Michael-Tanji/dp/1934840807">Threats in the Age of Obama.</a></p>
<p>My thanks for all who entered. I’ll see if I can make contests a more regular thing on War &amp; Health.</p>
<p>And Eddie, shoot me an email with your snailmail address.</p>

<p>My main complaint with the NYTimes graphic is that it does not show

<p>Erwin Rommel has fascinated me since childhood. The story of his 
career is the story of the German war itself: from the push across 
France, to the African campaign, to the assassination attempt on Hitler.
 Rommel played his role in all of it. The Desert Fox was also a true 
gentleman-soldier. He was ferocious on the battlefield, but 
exceptionally humane towards his enemies. This dichotomy can be seen in a
 memory of a close colleague:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the days that followed, Rommel continued to drive from one 
unit to another, usually through the British lines, in order to deal 
with continually recurring crises. On one occasion he went into a New 
Zealand hospital, which was still occupied by the enemy. By this time no
 one really knew who was captor and who captive — except Rommel, who was
 in no doubt. He inquired if anything was needed, promised the British 
medical supplies and drove on unhindered. (Liddell-Hart 1953, 164)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others might write-off this incident as mundane, but not me. Rommel’s
 behavior epitomizes the goals of the Geneva Convention: that wherever 
possible, wars must minimize human suffering. In the 21st century, we 
could learn much from Rommel’s humanity towards his enemies.</p>

<p>In the early 90s, the world’s militaries faced a dilemma. Peace 
enforcement operations, wherein UN troops aggressively ended 
hostilities, were seen as the next generation of peace operations. These
 operations were, in all practical terms, offensive military operations 
under the UN flag. However, their stronger mandate increased the risk of
 blue helmet casualties.</p>
<p>To provide some insight into the potential human costs of peace 
enforcement operations, Christopher G. Blood and Marlisa E. Anderson, 
working under the US Medical Information Systems and Operations Research
 Department, examined the casualty rates during the Battle of Hue. The 
author’s reasoning was that future UN operations would likely require US
 Marines to retake urban areas held by hostile forces. The duration and 
required force of the Battle of Hue “has applicability to estimating the
 levels of casualties which might be sustained in a U.N.-led military 
operation within an urban environment” (Blood and Anderson 1993, 3).</p>
<p>The authors collected data on Marine KIA, MIA, and DNBI (Disease/Non 
Battle Injuries) rates during the retaking of Hue and compared them to 
other phases of the battle (Mopping up operations etc…), different 
periods in the Vietnam war, and the Marine assault of Okinawa during 
WWII.</p>
<p>They found that while the casualty rate for the Battle of Hue 
experienced large fluctuations, the DNBI rate was relatively stable and 
consistent with the overall Marine rate during that period of the war. 
In contrast, significant changes in DNBI rates are seen in the Okinawa 
assault. Blood and Anderson concluded (using no formal statistical 
tests) that “increases in battle fatigue cases and illness tied to high 
levels of battlefield stress are more a function of sustained high 
intensity operations, rather than a high intensity battle within a 
light-to-moderate intensity conflict” (Blood and Anderson 1993, 12). In 
other words: do not underestimate the power of stress and fatigue in 
conflict.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  There are clear indications that thousands of IDPS have moved into the
 northern half of the CSZ between 5 &amp; 19 February 2009. A 
satellite-derived preliminary estimate based on automatic detection 
methods, indicates there are approximately 2,850 newly erected IDP 
shelter structures within the area designated PC9. This represents a 
minimum increase of over 100% from the total building count within CSZ 
of 2,600 as of 5/2/09. Because of incomplete imagery coverage over 
northern CSZ, there is a high probability that the IDP structure count 
is significantly higher. It is important to note that no newly erected 
IDP shelter structures were detected in the southern half of CSZ. There 
are several possible impact crater sites within the southern half of the
 CSZ, along with limited building damages.

<h3><a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2009/02/civilian-casual.html">Danger Room: Civilian Casualties Hit New Highs in Afghanistan</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>The fighting has grown more and more intense this year. 
So it’s no surprise that the civilian casualties in Afghanistan have 
spiked, as well. 2,118 innocents died in 2008 — an increase of 40 
percent, according to the U.N. Mission in Afghanistan. “This makes the 
2008 civilian death toll the highest of any year since… the fall of the 
Taliban regime at the end of 2001,” adds an annual report for the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In NATO and Poppy: The War Over Revenue, we discussed the
 U.S. and NATO program (then in the planning stages) to eradicate poppy 
since it provides a revenue stream to the Taliban. The Taliban also 
create income from marble quarries in Pakistan, extortion of cell phone 
providers in Afghanistan, ransom from kidnapping, and “protection” of 
small businesses.</p></blockquote>

 weapons in its recent attacks against Gaza, and Israel’s denial of 
this, raise an interesting question: is a customary norm against the use
 of depleted munitions* emerging? As scholars studying norm emergence, 
how would we know?</p></blockquote>

<p>In January, <a href="http://www.csis.org/">The Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies</a>, CSIS, interviewed <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=125">S. Ward Casscells</a>,
 The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs on their global 
health interview series. The audio of the short (less than five minute) 
interview is available <a href="http://media.csis.org/globalhealth/iseries_casscells.mp3">here</a>.
 This evening, I transcribed the interview for my own notes. Feel free 
to read my unofficial transcript below or listen to the entire interview
 on the CSIS website. Also, be sure to check out the great interviews by
 <a href="http://www.csis.org/globalhealth/interviews/">CSIS.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> This is the CSIS Global Health Policy Center Podcast</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Today we are joined by the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, S. Ward Casscells. Dr. 
Casscells is going to speak about the increasing role of the US military
 in global health. Dr. Casscells, what are the three goals of the 
military health system and what areas of global health does the US 
military work in?</p>
<p><strong>Casscells:</strong> Military health systems exists primarily 
to take care of our servicemen, their families, and our retirees. But 
secondarily, we assist the overall mission of the defense department by 
building capacity, health capabilities in countries that are critical to
 what we’re doing. Lastly, we try to do whatever good we can for global 
health in passing since we’re stationed in over 100 countries around the
 world.</p>
<p><strong>I:</strong> And how is health related to stability and security?</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> Well, generally health is a product of stability 
and prosperity. So, when people are safe and get access to health care, 
when they have electricity, roads, clean water, safe sewerage systems 
and the like, then they’re more likely to be healthy. They tend to have 
better food because they are more prosperous and so forth. But it also 
works the other way around, that when people are healthier, they are 
happier, they are more trusting of their government if they’ve gotten 
health benefits from their government. They plan for the future if 
people have some confidence that they and their children have a 
reasonable life expectancy, they make the kind of long term decisions, 
investing in education, investing in partnerships, learning a topic or 
trade that they wouldn’t do otherwise. So health contributes to 
prosperity and peace as a virtuous cycle. prosperity and peace 
contribute to health’s work.</p>
<p><strong>I:</strong> And what global programs do the US military 
engage in? You’ve talked a bit about military capacity building, 
pandemic flu. … Can you give us a quick overview of the different areas 
you work in?</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> Well, this past few years, combat casualty care 
has been critical. Preventive medicine, getting people vaccinated, 
boosting their nutrition, of soldiers, marines, and sailors. In teaching
 the kinds of things that can prevent accidents and prevent disease, 
these have been critical to what we’re doing. We’re challenged now by 
combat stress. PTSD has been a huge issue for us. And hidden …. But 
beyond the injuries and diseases that affect our soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, marines, we have the hosts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sovereign 
countries, with their invitation, it is our obligation to try to help 
them develop their health care facilities and their health care know-how
 so they can care for their own and so we can wind down there. 
Particularly in Afghanistan, where things have gotten more dangerous. 
And the hope is that being a provider of health to a village or helping 
them take care of themselves even better will be a way to get that 
village unified against terrorism so they are not intimidated or 
beguiled, so they have some faith in their own government, their own 
future.</p>

<p>In 2004, three doctors (Ahuka, Chabikuli and Ogunbanjo) examined 
maternity registries from CME Njankunde Hospital in Ituri District, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo. The data was collected between 1993-and 
2001, before and during the country’s devastating civil war. The 
researchers found that [Emphasis mine]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There were <strong>no statistically significant differences between the number of births before (5419) and during the war</strong> (5109).” (Ahuka, Chabikuli and Ogunbanjo 2004, 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lack of any meaningful change in the births is interesting. It <em>could</em>
 suggest that civilians continued to use the hospital with the same 
frequency both before and during the civil war. However, there is also 
the possibility that the <em>population</em> of patients changed and the constant usage rate is simply due to the hospital <em>always</em> operating at full capacity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Premature deliveries (10.47%) were the most frequent unfavorable pregnancy outcomes during the war</strong>, followed by stillbirths (3.79%), and abortions (3.3%).” (Ahuka, Chabikuli and Ogunbanjo 2004, 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There were three peaks at 2-yearly intervals during the war. <strong>The first peak in 1997 (11.4%)</strong> <strong>coincided
 with the onset of war, and the second and third peaks in 1999 (11.2%) 
and 2001 (11.5%), respectively, coincided with the rebel army movements 
to recapture Kinshasa, the country’s capital city.</strong>” (Ahuka, Chabikuli and Ogunbanjo 2004, 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, an informal eyeballing of the chart hints that the two
 rebel pushes against the capital were associated with different health 
outcomes. That is, the first rebel campaign had a meaningfully different
 effect on premature births in CME Njankunde than the second. It 
suggests that the evolution of tactics between 1999 and 2001 influenced 
the human cost of the conflict.</p>

<h3><a href="http://informationdissemination.blogspot.com/2009/02/israel-impounds-aid-ship.html">Israel Impounds aid ship headed to Gaza</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The ship set sail from the Lebanese port of Tripoli Tuesday in a bid 
to defy Israel’s blockade of Gaza. Reporters from Arab TV stations 
Al-Jadeed and Al-Jazeera who were on the vessel said the Israelis fired 
at the ship before boarding it and beating those on board.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://avuncularamerican.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/launching-medical-diplomacy-to-gaza.html">Gerald Loftus wants to send a US Hospital Ship to Gaza</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, perhaps the French and my skeptical American commenters 
are right: for “logistical” or “force protection” reasons, or simply, 
for medical effectiveness, maybe our hospital ships are needed more for 
amphibious exercises with allied nations. Preparing for some future 
disaster surely to strike in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>And maybe the US Government is justified in channeling its aid to 
Gaza – considerable as it is – through UN specialized agencies and the 
ICRC.</p>
<p>But I doubt seriously that there is any more urgent 
medical-humanitarian mission right now than Gaza. And whatever the form 
and amount of US aid to Gaza via the UN and the Red Cross, it doesn’t 
have the impact – and, let’s face it, the public diplomacy payoff – of a
 gleaming white hospital ship flying the US flag.</p>

<h3><a href="http://warisboring.com/?p=1568">SOUTHCOM responds to Earthquake in Costa Rica</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake killed at least 13 people in Costa Rica 
last week. Among the first responders was a joint U.S. Army-U.S. Air 
Force team flying Blackhawk helicopters. “The team, comprised of Army 
and Air Force aviation crews, rescue, medical and support members, 
supported ongoing efforts to search and locate victims of the natural 
disaster,” the Air Force reported.</p>

<p>Today, I stumbled upon an absolutely fascinating PBS Wide Angle documentary on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War">Second Chechen War</a> called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/greetings-from-grozny/video-full-episode/1112/">Greetings from Grozny</a>.
 The filmmakers embed with Chechen rebels, Russian special forces, and 
civilians. The film is packed with original and rarely seen footage. 
Best of all, the entire documentary is available free online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small and fiercely independent,the republic of Chechnya has been 
embroiled for years in a war for self-determination against Russia. The 
ruined cityscape of Grozny and the scarred roads and fields of the 
countryside bear witness to a conflict that has been marked both by 
brutal occupation and terrorist resistance. This film is a journey that 
leads the viewer behind the lines on both sides, and into the hearts of 
civilians and soldiers alike. Film crews accompany Russian troops on 
“cleansing missions” through residential districts of Grozny, and spend 
24 tense hours at a Russian checkpoint. They also go undercover in the 
border regions where a radical Islam increasingly motivates Chechen 
fighters and provides glimpses of the webs of special interest woven 
around this horrific conflict by the United States, the Wahabist Muslims
 and the Georgians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody would confused the Russian strategy with winning hearts and minds.</p>

<p>On April 10, 1943, Science News Letter published a great article on 
protecting the United States against wartime tuberculosis. Why great? 
Because of this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tuberculosis sanatoria are giving more than 22,000,000 patient days 
of treatment yearly; tuberculosis divisions of hospitals give about 
6,000,000. These figures, added to the man-days required to take care of
 patients by doctors, nurses, cooks and janitors, make a grand total of 
over 40,000,000 man,days yearly.”</p>
<p>This is enough time to build 160 destroyers, or 940 flying 
fortresses, or 8,000 combat planes, or 16,000 light tanks, or 20,000 
howitzers, or 34,000 jeeps, or 550,000 30-caliber machine guns. On the 
financial side, the cost is equally staggering. The cost of tuberculosis
 among veterans of the last war alone, before X-rays were used to detect
 tuberculosis in apparently healthy men and to prevent their being 
inducted into the Army, has passed the billion dollar mark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article advocates testing for TB by directly relating man-hours 
lost to the war effort. In this way the article merges public health 
with national security interests. That is, TB weakens the ability of the
 United States to wage war. To fight TB is to contribute to national 
security.</p>
<p>The combination of public health and national security fascinates me.
 It relates two, often considered disparate, topics: conflict and 
health. In most of recent history the concept of health professionals 
contributing to national security or military personnel promoting global
 health were largely unaddressed. But, as time passes and diseases 
exploit worldwide connectivity, the two fields will become more 
interdependent and intertwined.</p>

<blockquote><p>This map presents a preliminary and on-going 
satellite-based damage assessment for the Governorates of Gaza and Gaza 
North. Damaged buildings, infrastructure and impact craters have been 
identified with Quickbird (16 January 2009) and WorldView satellite 
imagery acquired on 19 &amp; 10 &amp; 6 January 2009, and received at a 
reduced spatial resolution of 2 meters. Pre-crisis Ikonos satellite 
imagery from June 2005 was also used. Affected buildings were classified
 either as destroyed or severely damaged by standard image 
interpretation methods. Destroyed buildings have been defined by the 
total collapse of the structure or when it was standing but with less 
than 50% of the roof still intact. Severely damaged buildings were 
defined as having visible structural damage to a portion of one wall, or
 where a section of the roof was damaged but with over 50% of the roof 
still intact.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am not above a shameless plug. Today, Amazon starts selling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934840807?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wahe-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1934840807">Threats in the Age of Obama</a><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/ir.gif" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" border="0" height="1" width="1">, a book edited by <a href="http://haftofthespear.com/">Michael Tanji</a>
 and containing a contribution by yours truly titled “Infectious 
Diseases, Foreign Militaries, and US National Security”. The book is a 
crash course on emerging national security threats. Each of the more 
than 20 contributors (and Michael) tackle a different aspect of national
 security, from cyberwarfare to public diplomacy.</p>
<p>My own contribution examines the role of health. Specifically, I 
explore the effect of global health / infectious diseases on foreign 
militaries and argue that their health vulnerabilities have a 
significant, negative impact on US national security.</p>
<p>I would publish my entire contribution on War &amp; Health, but I am 
pretty sure I signed something saying I wouldn’t. So instead, below is a
 little teaser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 21st century, infectious diseases are increasingly a serious 
threat to the national security of the United States, even if they 
strike outside the nation’s borders. The lessons learned from the effect
 of HIV/AIDS in African militaries reveal the necessity of giving health
 concerns a more central position in discussions of national security. 
In particular, US programs to strengthen the effectiveness of developing
 world security forces must also increase their health capacity. The 
United States has a national security interest in strengthening the 
capacity of friendly foreign armed forces to respond to infectious 
diseases within their ranks. The framework for this program already 
exists. The United States’ African Contingency Operations Training and 
Assistance program boosts the capacity of African militaries to conduct 
peacekeeping and humanitarian missions on the continent. The program’s 
greatest challenge, according to one commentator, is that the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic is crippling the participating militaries before they can be 
effectively deployed. Enlarging the role of health capacity building in 
this and similar programs offers a means to make friendly militaries 
more resistant to infectious disease, increasing their ability to 
provide domestic, international, and regional stability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today starts a new series of posts called ‘Good Reads’. I am a 
voracious collector of news stories, articles, journals, reports, and 
data on armed conflict and public health. I attempt to write about many 
of them on this site, however inevitably every week a dozen or more 
items remain ‘unblogged’. The goal of this and future Good Reads posts 
is to get these items out to readers. Enjoy! If you have comments and 
suggestions, I would love to hear them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/01/solar-powered-medical-clinic-iraq.php">Solar Powered Medical Clinic in Iraq</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In Iraq, where rolling blackouts and severe electricity 
restrictions plague the nation, a reliable power supply can mean the 
difference between life and death. Without it, important medical centers
 can’t provide the necessary treatment to the wounded. So it was a 
stunning achievement for the American-Iraqi Multinational Force—and a 
great moment for solar power technology—when an Iraqi-led group designed
 and installed a photovoltaic cell system on a Baghdad medical clinic.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://monthlyreview.org/090112brouwer.php"><strong>Cuban Revolutionary Medicine</strong></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Their experience is the newest reflection of how Cuba, in
 concert with the people of many nations in Africa, Latin America, and 
the Caribbean, is transforming the training of doctors, nurses, and 
other health professionals while also delivering medical care to poor 
populations that, in the past, seldom received any attention at all. 
This dynamic notion, planted by Che and others at the beginning of the 
Revolution, has taken decades finally to develop, and now has come to 
fruition: thousands of doctors have been created who are capable of 
practicing and teaching revolutionary medicine, and they are puting this
 “weapon” to good use.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Palestinian civilians, living in Gaza during the 
three-week war with Israel, have spoken of the challenge of being caught
 between Hamas and Israeli soldiers, as the radical Islamic movement 
that controls the Gaza strip attempted to hijack ambulances</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-300-400_files/usnsmercy.jpg" alt="USNSMercy.jpg" class="frame" height="150" width="480"></p>
<p>Will Youmans, a fellow at the Palestine Center and <a href="http://www.ironsheik.biz/">hip-hop artist</a> has put out a brief in which <a href="http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/display/ContentDetails/i/3939/pid/2254/TPL/InformationBrief/displaytype/raw">he argues that President Obama should dispatch the hospital ship USNS Mercy to Gaza</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most powerful and visible symbols of American empathy with
 those in disaster-hit areas is the USNS Mercy, the leading hospital 
ship in the U.S. Navy. As a ship committed to emergency medical care, it
 is one of America’s most notable tools of medical diplomacy, having 
gained attention for its humanitarian contributions in tsunami-hit Asia 
in 2006. It would provide more capacity for health care and make a more 
prominent public diplomacy statement to the Arab world.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For a Barack Obama administration looking towards a new path of 
engagement with Arab and Muslim countries, sending substantive direct 
medical help to the people of Gaza would be both a significant gesture 
and a useful intervention to relieve mounting health care demands. The 
USNS Mercy and other hospital ships could perfectly fit such a mission, 
and they have in the past elsewhere. While this may not erase the harm 
done to American credibility during the Bush administration, it would be
 a visible step in the direction of re-positioning the United States–a 
departure from the previous President’s reckless disregard for civilian 
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As readers probably already know, I am a strong supporter of hospital
 ships for medical diplomacy. However, in this particular case a 
hospital ship is inappropriate and will send the wrong message. A major 
(and not unreasonable) criticism of employing the Navy as medical 
diplomats is that, no matter their true intentions, the mission is still
 a US military operation using military equipment. This was even an 
issue for the USS Kearsarge in Nicaragua where the US is on good terms. 
Thus, I hesitate to imagine how a US military ship off the Gazan coast 
would play out in the arab street (whatever its hull color).</p>
<p>The population of Gaza was just devastated by US weapon systems sold to Israel. Those <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/gaza-white-phosphorus">controversial Israeli white phosphorus artillery rounds</a> were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oMwWoPmElU">made in a small town in Arkansas.</a>
 The IDF AH-64s, F-16s, F-15s, M4s and M16s are also made in the US. The
 only thing the Gazan people want to see less than the Israeli military 
is the US military.</p>

<p>At the end of 2008, the National Intelligence Council released report ICA 2008-10D, titled “<a href="http://www.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_otherprod/ICA_Global_Health_2008.pdf">Strategic Implications of Global Health</a>“. The report expanded on the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wilsoncenter.org%2Ftopics%2Fpubs%2FReport6-3.pdf&amp;ei=Kk53SY-sJ5GYsAPw4oXQAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTF0HfGW4lfD74z-LhEsVJvp9VFw&amp;sig2=SSHUyqm4YKkvZhy3CoWP_w">2000 National Intelligence Estimate on the threats from infectious diseases to the United States</a> by including a wider variety of global health issues, including malnutrition and maternal mortality.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the report’s key findings (regarding threats). I
 have italicized points directly relevant to stability and armed 
conflict.</p>
<h3>Reconstruction and Stabilization:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Inability of the central government of Afghanistan to provide 
health-care and other services has helped to undermine its credibility 
while boosting support for a resurgent and increasingly sophisticated 
Taliban.</em></li>
<li><em>A degraded health sector, shortages of medical personnel, and 
infections stemming from deficient sanitary conditions and lack of clean
 drinking water in Iraq have undermined the credibility of the central 
government.</em></li>
<li>In both countries poor reproductive health among girls and women is a
 major impediment to advancing female education and workforce 
participation, both of which are important to enhancing prospects for 
economic growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rising Powers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Russia has the overall worst health indicators of any industrialized
 country, and poor health undercuts efforts to diversify economic 
activity away from oil into more skill-intensive and value-added 
sectors. <em>P</em><em>oor health of Russian children and young people combined with falling birthrates also threatens Russian military readiness.</em></li>
<li>China’s high incidence of chronic disease—stemming in great part 
from heavy tobacco use —threatens to slow Chinese economic growth by 
incapacitating workers and incurring heavy health-care costs. T<em>he 
health effects of industrial pollution are an increasing source of 
discontent in China, while the recent outcry over contaminated baby 
formula seemed to weaken government credibility regarding the ability of
 the government to ensure public health and safety.</em></li>
<li>India suffers from rampant malnutrition and anemia that cross all 
socio-economic classes, putting the majority of Indian children at high 
risk for impaired physical and cognitive disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adversarial States and Nonstate Actors:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Malnutrition-related cognitive disabilities among North Korean 
children and young people likely will impact future economic growth in 
that country regardless of when Pyongyang opens to the outside world or 
reunifies with the South. <em>Nationwide malnutrition has compelled 
Pyongyang to lower minimum height and weight requirements for military 
service, and an estimated 17 to 29 percent of potential North Korean 
military conscripts between 2009 and 2013 will have cognitive 
deficiencies disqualifying them for service</em>.</li>
<li><em>Venezuela and Cuba have been particularly adept at parlaying 
provision of charitable medical services to nationals of other countries
 into support in international forums such as the United Nations.</em></li>
<li><em>Hezbollah’s provision of health and social services in Lebanon 
over the past 20 years has helped to legitimize the organization as a 
political force in that country, while HAMAS’s delivery of similar 
services was a factor in its winning of legislative elections in the 
Palestinian territories.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the report is spot on. Global health is not the exclusive 
realm of aid workers and Irish musicians. Rather, the health of <em>other</em>
 countries has significant tactical, operational, strategic, and grand 
strategic implications for the United States. Rising global 
interdependence only increases the importance of global health and the 
need to incorporate health into foreign policy. Beyond its contents, the
 report is indicative of Washinton’s increased interest in the 
implications of health in international politics and conflict.</p>

<p>In December, Joby Warrick of the Washington Post published a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/25/AR2008122500931.html">story on the use of Viagra to win over the support of Afghan tribal leaders and warlords</a>.
 Paying for support is nothing new. The strategy has been employed 
countless times and produced well publicized successes. The largest 
example recently is the Sons of Iraq, wherein 90,000 Iraqi 
paramilitaries (including insurgents) were placed on the US payroll. 
These forces were widely credited for stabilizing many regions, 
including Al Anbar.</p>
<p>What is significant about the use of Viagra is the direct employment 
of western medical technology to win support at the tactical level. Now,
 as Warrick points out, buying support with Viagra is by no means 
common, likely because the warlord must be old enough to need the drug 
but healthy enough to not die from taking it. However, it would be 
interesting to see how drugs or medical procedures are being used in 
conflicts to gain favor with political elites.</p>
<p>Overall, the article reiterates a common theme on War &amp; Health: 
that health care and public health can be an effective tool in armed 
conflict, at the tactical, operational, and/or strategic levels.</p>

<p>Recently there has been a number of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gpsd7GlgD5FkIQiK2upUs2akmBTw">news stories</a>
 about the Israeli Defense Force’s use of white phosphorus, also known 
as WP or Willie Pete. White phosphorus is a standard weapon in 20th 
century armies. Its use as a weapon was commonplace in WWII and many 
other conflicts.</p>
<p>Beyond the technical details, white phosphorus is a a waxy substance 
that burns brightly and produces a large amount of smoke when lit. White
 phosphorus has two main military uses. First, it is often employed as a
 means of producing smoke to cover military maneuvers from observation 
or to mark a location. Second, white phosphorus is used as an incendiary
 weapon against enemy forces. More specifically, if a canister of white 
phosphorus is ignited in the air over a target, the area underneath will
 be showered by small waxy and burning particles. Those pieces can stick
 to clothes and skin, causing external chemical burns. White phosphorus 
will burn until it disappears or is deprived of oxygen and thus often 
causes horrific damage to exposed flesh, sometimes burning down to the 
bone. Furthermore, individuals can inhale the particles, causing 
internal burns. Both of these uses are legal under international laws of
 war.</p>
<p>The controversy around white phosphorus lies in the risk to 
civilians. The purposeful use of white phosphorus against civilian 
populations is a clear violation of international law. However, in many 
urban battlefields where white phosphorus has been used, such as Gaza 
2009, Falluja 2004, and Grozy 1994, enemy fighters and civilian 
populations occupy the same area, often the same building. White 
phosphorus is not a precision weapon. A white phosphorus attack against 
Hamas fighters next to a civilian home will in all likelihood shower 
both with incandescent particles of phosphorus. Furthermore, the toxic 
smoke (which itself causes skin irritation) might either kill the 
civilians by suffocation or drive them out into the open where they risk
 being mistaken for enemy combatants.</p>
<p>Update Via <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2009/01/white-phosphoru.html#more">Danger Room:</a>
 “In Gaza, even the Red Cross accepts that the intention is probably to 
use WP to create smoke rather than to deliberately injure; the 
Associated Press quotes the ICRC’s Peter Herby as saying: “It’s not very
 unusual to use phosphorus to create smoke or illuminate a target. We 
have no evidence to suggest it’s being used in any other way.”</p>
<p>Update 2: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/15/gaza.aid.plea/index.html">CNN is reporting</a> that the central UN humanitarian storehouse in Gaza is on fire and that “the source of the fires as white phosphorous shells…”</p>

<p>This week War &amp; Health is one year old. The site has had a good 
year: more than 100 substantial posts, hundreds of subscribers, 
thousands of visitors, and citations by dozens of respected 
publications/organizations including Wired’s <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/">Danger Room</a> and the New York Times’ <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/">The Lede</a>. However, I know War &amp; Health can do better.</p>
<p>You see, for the last seven months your author has been under the 
guillotine of comprehensive exams. The pressure to prepare made time 
zero-sum: any time writing/researching about armed conflict and public 
health was hours of studying lost. Writing for this site was reduced to a
 guilty pleasure, indulged on Saturday nights after 12+ hours of 
studying for the exams. The necessary neglect of writing on armed 
conflict and public health has been frustrating, for the topic covered 
on War &amp; Health is not just my research focus, it is <em>my passion</em>.</p>
<p>So, it was with great pleasure that on January 8th I turned in my 
last comprehensive exam, also described as “the last test you will ever 
take”. The results will not be known for a few weeks, but whatever the 
outcome, whether I continue at UC Davis or take advantage of a different
 opportunity (see post scriptum), this site will not be so neglected 
again.</p>
<p>Happy New Years reader, and look out for some great commentary, news, and analysis on War &amp; Health in the coming months!</p>
<p>Your author,<br>

<p>Christopher Albon</p>
<p>P.S. A special thank you goes out to those of you who offered me many
 great and tempting opportunities if I leave my academic studies. The 
offers are both flattering and appreciated.</p>

 colonial New England, the only method of smallpox inoculation was the 
transfer of pus from a smallpox pustule onto the skin of a healthy 
individual. While the practice of inoculation was common amongst Native 
Americans, Blacks, and the British Army, it was considered repulsive by 
Colonists. For this reason inoculation was highly restricted or even 
prohibited is a large portion of New England.</p>
<p>General Washington’s attempts to inoculate his troops from smallpox 
were often blocked by these restrictions. As such, his army was 
repeatedly devastated by outbreaks.</p>

<p>Right now, on India’s CNN-IBN news channel, a man with the title of 
“citizen journalist” is interviewing people the morning after the main 
attack. The 2008 terrorist attacks will be known as the first reported 
primarily via social media. A majority of footage and accounts shown by 
CNN, BBC, and IBN were from citizens using cell phones cameras, text 
messages, Wikipedia, blogs, and Twitter. Noah Shachtman described the 
attacks as being described “tweet by tweet”. CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/27/mumbai.twitter/index.html?eref=rss_latest">has called</a>
 yesterday “the day social media appeared to come of age and signaled 
itself as a news gathering force to be reckoned with.” One man told CNN:
 “Even before I actually heard of it on the news I saw stuff about this 
on Twitter”.</p>
<p>Particularly active was the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/11/first-hand-acco.html">#mumbai</a> thread on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>lwaldal: RT many: If you are in #mumbai, give blood by 
smsing BLOOD [blood group] to 96000 97000, someone will call up for 
donation.</p>
<p>shahpriya: RT @schmmuck it seems that the police van that was hijacked was the one the late vijay salaskar was traveling in !!</p></blockquote>
<p>But #mumbai was not just for reporting, Shlok Vaidya, an energy 
security analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, used 
the <a href="http://twitter.com/shloky">#mumbai channel for analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>#mumbai If the cargo ship is true, it was sloppy and from
 and old era of terrorism. Points to legacy thinkers – governments, 
major org etc</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a>, a new project for crowdsourced crisis mapping, played no role in the reporting. Rather a mix of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/26_November_2008_Mumbai_attacks">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=18.922445,72.832242&amp;spn=0.007054,0.007864&amp;z=17&amp;msid=105055855763538009401.00045c9d8b16af3ad1008">Google Maps</a> were the tools of choice to aggregate and track the Mumbai attacks in near real time.</p>
<p>These attacks prove the potential role of Ushahidi in future crises, 
however the events of the past 24 hours also demonstrate that Ushahidi 
needs to be faster and more automated to maximize its usefulness. The 
attacks occurred the day before Thanksgiving, making any attempt to use 
the system to Mumbai less likely. Furthermore, if the system took even a
 day to deploy, citizen journalists would have already clustered and 
amassed around other social media services to aggregate and map the 
crisis before Ushahidi could open its doors. If faster and more 
automated, Ushahidi could be a major aggregator of social media data 
during future crises.</p>

 n an innovative paper, Matthew Smallman-Raynor and Andrew Cliff 
(previously mentioned on War &amp; Health) explore the spread of three 
infectious diseases (enteric fever, smallpox, and yellow fever) during 
the Cuban insurrection (1895-1898). The authors extracted geospatial 
data on infectious diseases from sanitary dispatches from the United 
States Marine Corps Hospital Service and the US Consular Service. On 
this historical data, the authors run GIS analysis to determine the 
spatial relationship between infectious diseases and the political 
conflict.</p>
<p>The authors reached a number of conclusions. First, the war caused 
populations to condense, facilitating the spread of disease. Second, the
 war created increased transmission rates. Third, fighting increased the
 speed at which the diseases spread. Fourth, (and most important for 
readers of War &amp; Health) the spread of disease was shaped by the 
location of hostilities. That is, disease spread with the fighting.</p>
<p>A central argument on this site is that health in conflict zones can 
only be understood through an appreciation for the dynamics of the 
conflicts themselves. Smallman-Raynor and Cliff’s fourth conclusion 
lends unequivocal support for this claim.</p>

 following paragraph was published in the New York Times on May 25th, 
1915 in an article titled: “Typhus Fever is as Old as Warfare”. This 
paragraph could describe a dozen conflicts since then, including some 
current ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Civilization is only a thin crust, covering possibilities of relapse 
into savagery. Long ages have been required to bring civilized man by 
slow and painful stages to his present condition. Only a few months are 
required for him to relapse into the condition of barbarism from which 
he emerged. In times of great disaster, when the conventions of 
civilized society are removed, man again becomes an individualist, 
striving like primitive man or like the beasts of the jungle for food 
and shelter and even for life itself, and ruthlessly abandoning any 
refinements or customs which might impede him. Under such conditions, he
 easily reverts to the habits of his former savage state. Even the 
diseases of barbarism return.

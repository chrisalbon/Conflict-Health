In a <a href="http://warandhealth.com/attacking-humanitarians-as-a-strategy/">previous blog post I argued</a>
 armed groups attack humanitarians to prevent them from winning the 
minds and wills of populations. Now it seems the Foreign Policy 
Association agrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I, and Stratfor agrees, believe that they are mainly targeted as 
way to embarrass/undermine the Afghan government and NATO troop 
presence. These workers are trying to spread education, health, 
infrastructure, business, and good governance in the nation, and if they
 are successful, along with the Afghan government, the Taliban are 
cooked. As in their ability to replace the government will become less 
likely. They need to foment instability and chaos in places where the 
Afghan government is present and solidify their rule where it is absent.
 Concerning NATO and foreign NGOs, many European nations and groups 
support for the ISAF and Afghan state building are becoming shaky and 
less long-term committal, and these aid worker attacks are not making 
them feel any better. The resolve of the Afghan people, Afghan 
government, NATO forces, NGOs, and NATO home citizens is being 
challenged by these Taliban attacks. We have to be ready to meet these 
challenges, for the alternative is a ruler who believes no one is safe, 
not even Muslim aid workers building schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could not have said it better.</p>

 Researchers have found a relationship between sea surface temperature, 
sea surface height, and cholera epidemics. Professor Rita Colwell 
proposes that satellites could be used to measure the latter two and 
thus predict regions at risk.</p>
<p>While Professor Colwell’s work is interesting and I am a big fan of 
satellite based analysis, as a political scientist, I wonder if this 
could be applied to conflict zones. Cholera and armed violence have 
always been linked. Almost all major armed conflicts in human history 
are accompanied by cholera outbreaks. Given this close connection, can 
satellites help predict and map cholera during conflicts? I think so.</p>
<p>In a 1999 paper, Matthew Smallman-Raynor and Andrew Cliff found that 
the Cuban insurrection shaped the spatial course of infectious disease 
epidemics in the country (not cholera, however):</p>
<blockquote><p>… the spatial course of epidemics in wartime was dictated
 by a shifting locus of hostilities, with early involvement of the 
south-Eastern province of Oriente and a drift away from this initial 
focus as the insurrection progressed. In contrast, the pre-war period 
was characterized by a mortality centre that was rooted in the 
north-western and central provinces of the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Colwell’s modeling technique does not include information on human 
behavior (namely violence and population movements). However, in theory 
her technique could be combined with traditional intelligence sources to
 generate a prediction map of cholera risk in conflict zones.</p>

<p>The above graph tracks the incidence of cholera in Iraq from August 15 to October 30, 2008. The September outbreak <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/corruption-blamed-as-cholera-rips-through-iraq-956701.html">has been blamed</a> on corrupt officials using expired Iranian chlorine which failed to sterilize local water supply:</p>
<blockquote><p>This year, the government hoped to stop another outbreak 
of the disease by repairing shattered water and sanitation stations and 
putting chlorine in the water supply. An Iraqi government official, who 
did not want his name published, said the Health Ministry bought $11m 
(£6.4m) worth of chlorine from Iran for use in the provinces of Babil, 
Diwaniyah and Kerbala, all on the Euphrates river south of Baghdad.</p>
<p>In the latter two provinces, officials noticed that the chlorine was 
old and the time during which it could be employed effectively had 
expired, and refused to use it. But in Babil the chlorine was put in the
 fresh water supply stations at al-Madhatiyah, al-Hashimiyah and 
al-Qasim, south-east of the provincial capital, al-Hillah. Soon 222 
people were confirmed as having cholera in Babil, in a total of 420 
cases of whom seven have died.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time politics has shaped cholera in Iraq. In 2007, insurgents <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/03/AR2007060300340.html">detonated a number</a> of chlorine trucks in improvised chemical attacks. As a result, the US and Iraqi government <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/09/22/news/nation/18_25_079_21_07.txt">began holding up chlorine imports at the Jordanian border</a>
 due to fears of their use as VBIEDs (Vehicle Based Improvised Explosive
 Devices). However, chlorine is a key tool in preventing the spread of 
cholera. The resulting chlorine shortage allowed an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/world/middleeast/12iraq.html">epidemic of cholera</a> to spread across Iraq, infecting more than 7000 Iraqis.</p>

<p>Ten months ago, War &amp; Health <a href="http://warandhealth.com/ushahidi-and-disaster-informational-exchanges/">discussed</a> a little known, but promising, project called <a title="Ushahidi" href="http://ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a>.
 Born from the 2007/2008 electoral violence in Kenya, Ushahidi is a new 
way to report and gain low-level, real-time intelligence in crisis 
zones. Today, Ushahidi, in partnership with some NGOs, took a big step 
forward and deployed their system in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Ushahidi allows individuals to report instances of 
violence, looting, and other incidents via&nbsp; local SMS messages. The
 report is then displayed on a web-based map using the Ushahidi engine. A
 more detailed explanation is offered in the diagram below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="frame" src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/019.jpg" alt="019.jpg" height="343" width="480"></p>
<p>I am a strong supporter of Ushahidi and I believe it will become a 
standard part of any humanitarian’s toolkit. That said, the project 
still has work to do. Presently, while the project is an innovative 
technological tool, it has yet to be connected with the interests of the
 policy folks. How well Ushahidi’s crowdsourcing methods mesh with the 
operations of NGOs? Of international peacekeepers? Does the project 
offer a value-added service to existing local health information 
networks? What is the potential for armed groups to exploit Ushahidi’s 
crowdsourced design? How best can the raw information collected be 
converted into reliable and actionable intelligence? In the coming 
weeks, War &amp; Health will publish a series of articles looking at 
Ushahidi from a political science / policy perspective. Stay tuned.</p>

<blockquote><p>Paula Lloyd was interviewing locals in the southern 
village of Maywand on Tuesday as part of her duties in a Human Terrain 
Team, which embeds civilian cultural experts into U.S. combat units. She
 approached a man carrying a fuel jug and they began talking about the 
price of gas. Suddenly, the man doused Lloyd in a flammable liquid and 
set her on fire. She suffered second- and third-degree burns over 60 
percent of her body, a Human Terrain source told Danger Room.</p>
<p>The injuries could have been worse. Lloyd’s teammate immediately 
threw her into a nearby water source to douse the flames, then Lloyd was
 sped to a nearby medical facility. Fortunately, the first doctor to 
treat her was a U.S. Army burn specialist. After being stabilized, Lloyd
 was evacuated to the military’s Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in 
Germany and is now en route to Brooke Army Medical Center in San 
Antonio. Lloyd is in “stable, but guarded condition,” the source said.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">M</span> ichael Yon’s recent post has a <a href="http://www.michaelyon-online.com/death-in-the-corn-part-iii-of-iii.htm">nice anecdote</a> on how quickly civilians can become ‘insurgents’ in battles for minds and wills:</p>
<blockquote><p>On 02 September, the enemy sniper was at it again, and so
 five British snipers (in the photo above, one sniper was behind me) 
were searching for probable firing positions. At one point, there was 
credible information that the Taliban told the sniper that they could 
provide him an American scope. The sniper said he was happy with his 
iron sights. He was a terrible shot, but sooner or later he might get 
lucky.</p>
<p>The Brits know exactly who the sniper is. About half a dozen fruit 
trees occluded fields of fire, so the soldiers cut them down. The Brits 
offered to pay for the trees, but were bound by regulations on how much 
they could pay. Major Adam Dawson told me the amount was something like 
$20 per tree, which of course is tantamount to zero. Achmed, an Afghan 
neighbor, came to collect the money, but the owner of the fruit tress 
had told Achmed not to accept payment. The owner was livid, saying: “I 
can’t believe Achmed let them cut down my trees! I’m going to go 
@#%&amp; his wife!” I don’t know if anything happened to Achmed’s wife, 
but I do know that the Brits said the owner of the fruit trees bought 
himself a sniper rifle. He’s been shooting at [FOB] Gibraltar ever 
since.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he latest addition to China’s budding navy is a hospital ship. As reported by <a href="http://informationdissemination.blogspot.com/2008/10/type-920-hospital-ship.html">Information Dissemination</a>, China’s Type 920 Hospital Ship has completed sea trials and entered service. <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/type-920.htm">Global Security offers a great analysis</a> of the ship’s role in China’s grand strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some have suggested that the new Type 920 hospital ship will be 
making a humanitarian tour in the South Pacific to reinforce other soft 
power gains made in that region over the last few years. … China’s 
launch of its first large naval hospital ship in August 2007 seemed to 
some to demonstrate an intention to project increased “soft power” in 
the maritime realm. There is no inherent reason why China’s already 
significant domestic maritime disaster relief capabilities could not be 
mobilized in the future to provide humanitarian assistance overseas. The
 Chinese government recognizes the value of humanitarian assistance, 
medical diplomacy and national responses to international natural 
disasters. Providing medical assistance to needy countries, particularly
 in response to natural disasters, improves international image through 
people-to-people diplomacy as well as effective communications 
campaigns.</p>

 &amp; Hultman’s great study about the deliberate killing of civilians 
finds rebels are nearly six times as likely to target civilians than 
government forces during territorial conflict. The authors find the 
results puzzling since rebels often rely on local populations for 
support and protection. Their explanation is that the disparity in the 
targeting of civilians is caused by the prevalence of ethnic-based 
rebellions using cleansing-like strategies to assert authority over a 
territory.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>wo-thirds of military casualties 
during the American Civil War were caused by infectious diseases. Both 
armies kept excellent public health and sanitation records during the 
war, however, almost all Confederate records were destroyed during the 
burning of Richmond, VA. Diarrhea was so common amongst Union (and 
Confederate) troops that the expression for bravery, “have the guts”, 
came from soldier slang for being strong enough to stand the symptoms. 
At the start of the war, basic sanitation and hygiene were largely 
ignored by Union officers, reflected in the initially high levels of 
diarrhea and dysentery. During the later years of the conflict, the 
realization that sanitation improvements helped maintain force strength 
produced a dramatic drop in both diarrhea and dysentery amongst Union 
armies.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>e have some smart readers at War &amp;
 Health and this has never been so clearly demonstrated than in the last
 few days. Early in the week, I briefly <a href="http://warandhealth.com/two-experts-give-the-coast-guard-hospital-ships/">discussed a proposal</a>
 to add hospital ships to the US Coast Guard. Over the next few days I 
received counter-arguments in the comments section and over email from a
 number of highly experienced and knowledgeable readers. The primary 
counterclaim is that the USCG is grossly undermanned to crew one, let 
alone many, hospital ships. Two great comments from TEJ and Leesea 
summarize the problem:</p>
<p>TEJ Writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>CG only has a dozen or so physician assistants. The 50 or
 so medical officers, 50 or so dental officers, and dozen or so 
pharmacists are all detailed from the US Public Health Service. All the 
CG nurses are civilians. The USCGR has no medical, dental, pharmacy, or 
nurse officers. Even the CG Auxilliary has let die on the vine its 
limited medical officer program. The US Navy, with its huge medical, 
nurse, medical service, etc. corps has difficulty apring enough 
practitioners to field these missions. I don’t see how the CG could do 
it. You can’t inflate their (borrowed) medical, dental, nurse, medical 
service corps by 200% just to be able to surge them out every other 
summer. Besides, the creation of DHS has stretched the CG thin with LE 
missions, they are not in the market for an additional non-core mission.</p></blockquote>
<p>Leesea Writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As someone who helped introduce the Hospital Ships to 
MSC, I think I can say conclusively that the USCG is completely under 
manned and not set up to operate them. What the authors fail to 
appreciate is that the crew alone on these ships ranges from 25 in ROS 
to 125 CIVMARs in FOS. The Medical Treatment Facility aka hospital, 
ranges from 40 to 1200. The MSC provides all the ship’s crew while large
 MTF/Hospitals and the naval reserves provides all the needed medical 
and support personnel. The USCG &amp; PHS are simply NOT sized or 
structured for T-AH operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>I cannot speak for the authors, but I (personally) never envisioned 
Coast Guard medical personnel manning the hospital ships. Rather, the 
Coast Guard would be charged with coordinating the operation and 
operating the ships, while the mission’s medical personnel (riders) 
would be drawn from all branches of the armed forces, allied states, and
 partner NGOs. This mixed medical staff has already been tried with 
success on the USS Boxer and USS Kearsarge. To be clear, I am not 
claiming the USCG is better suited than the Navy for health diplomacy, 
in fact I <a href="http://www.terraplexic.org/review/2008/10/19/learning-medical-diplomacy.html">discussed the Navy’s role in health diplomacy</a>
 just last week. Rather, I am interested in debating the relative merits
 and challenges faced by employing different institutions in health 
diplomacy.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">C</span>raig Hooper from the Naval Postgraduate School and Lt. Jim Dolbow, USCGR, have a great article this week in <a href="http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2008/November/Pages/ToWinHeartsandMinds,GiveCoastGuardNewHospitalShips.aspx?PF=1">National Defense Magazine</a>. In the article, the authors lay out the case for adding both small and large hospital ships to the Coast Guard fleet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Coast Guard operates in a diplomatic space that the Navy is 
unable to replicate, and offers the United States another avenue to 
engage in politically sensitive disaster response and medical outreach 
projects.</p>
<p>Hospital ships are, by design, multi-use vehicles that are capable of
 serving in command and control, educational outreach, or as virtual sea
 bases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hooper and Dolbow propose a two-tiered fleet of US Coast Guard 
hospital ships. Larger ships would serve as command-and-control for a 
number of smaller ambulance-type craft. The authors offer a number of 
possible hull designs for the fleet including France’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_%28L9013%29">Mistral amphibious assault ship</a> (shown above), Japan’s <a href="http://www.military-today.com/navy/oosumi_class.htm">Oosumi amphibious transport dock</a>, and the United States’ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_class_dry_cargo_ship">Lewis and Clark dry cargo ship</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with Hooper and Dolbow. Hospital ships would serve well in 
the Coast Guards current role. Furthermore, the use of Coast Guard ships
 in health diplomacy might deflect <a href="http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B1CA40D78-6334-4F5A-88A2-1FB7ED6DA11B%7D&amp;language=EN">some of the anti-imperialist rhetoric</a> produced by a grey hull parked off foreign soil.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We try to put an Afghan face on what we do because we 
want people to accept the government of the Islamic Republic of 
Afghanistan,” the captain said. “It’s very important that the people 
support and work with the government. That’s the long term goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In counterinsurgency, the battle is over the support of the 
population. Winning population support occurs slowly and thus any large 
counterinsurgency effort must position actions within a long time 
horizon. That is, counterinsurgency is about winning the population’s 
support today, tomorrow, and forever.</p>
<p>Providing health services to populations is one way to win support 
and training local indigenous health personnel is a way to extend that 
support long into the future. Furthermore, it is likely the public 
support benefit from providing health services to populations is an 
exponential effect. The positive effect on population support increases 
with time. That is, at any given moment, a force providing health care 
for two years likely benefits more than a force providing health care 
for two weeks.</p>
<p>Training local health personnel thus offers an increasing benefit to 
population support through being able to provide sustained, long term 
health care to populations.</p>

 British soldiers died in the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina. A 
less known statistic is that in the decades following the conflict a 
reported 264 British Falkland veterans committed suicide. Thus, the 
Falklands War holds the ignoble but common characteristic causing more 
British suicides than combat casualties.</p>
<p>The suicide statistics for veterans of the Falklands War and other 
deployments was the subject of a 2002 lawsuit by British veterans 
claiming the Ministry of Defense did not adequately care for soldiers 
with Posttramatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), widely believed to be 
correlated with suicide.</p>
<p>While data on British Iraq War military suicides is hard to come by. A 2004 <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1455087/Seven-veterans-of-Iraq-war-have-committed-suicide.html">Telegraph</a>

all my own videos and photos:</p>
<p>06:00 – Revelle, get up, get dressed, pack a bag, go to the Wardroom / Mess and eat a full breakfast.</p>
<p>06:15 – Head down to the hanger deck for muster.</p>
<p>06:30 – Stand with your stick (group), get an MRE (Packaged Army Meal).</p>
<p>06:30 to 7:30 – Wait around on the main ramp to the flight deck (good time to get a nap).</p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/ramp.jpg" alt="ramp.jpg" height="360" width="480"></p>
<p>07:30 – Walk onto the flight deck and board the CH-53E helicopter.</p>
<p>08:00 – Land in the FOB (Forward Operating Base) at the Puerto Cabezas airport.</p>

(optometry, dental, general medicine, pharmacy, veterinarian, etc…)</p>
<p>08:30 to 2:30pm – Work in the clinic, averaging 200-250 patients per 
day. Eat an MRE lunch in the back room of the school’s auditorium.</p>

<p>On April 15th 1961, CIA operated B-26B bombers took off from a covert
 CIA-built airstrip in Nicaragua, codenamed ‘Happy Valley’. Their 
mission was to support an upcoming amphibious landing in Cuba’s Bahía de
 Cochinos, better known as the Bay of Pigs. Today, 47 years later on 
that same airstrip, US Marine Corp CH-53E helicopters landed carrying US
 military doctors, nurses, dentists, public health experts, and myself. 
Stepping off the helicopter, I murmured four words: Welcome to Happy 
Valley.</p>
<p>The airport hosts a Navy Seabee base camp next to a small Nicaraguan Army base. The entirety of the base camp is visible below.</p>

<p>Getting to the medical site (a local high school) involves a short 
ride on a chartered local bus. An escort truck can be seen in front.</p>

<p>When I arrived at mid-morning the high school grounds were alive with people. This is the front of the line.</p>

<p>Even without most of their equipment (including chairs and lights), 
the dental team performed five extractions and 39 oral hygiene 
checkups/fluoride treatments. The women in the background is a patient 
sitting in the improvised dental chair (a school desk) placed next to a 
window.</p>

<p><a href="http://conflicthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/044small.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-234" style="float: right;" title="David Axe Interviewing" src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/044small.jpg" alt="" height="235" width="314"></a>The
 vague term ‘New Media’ popularly refers to the recent phenomena of 
amateur, semi-professional, and professional online journalists (often 
called bloggers). While I am a researcher and not a journalist in any 
form, my site War &amp; Health uses blogging software, and it were my 
writings on War &amp; Health that got me invited by the Department of 
Defense (DoD) to deploy with the USS Kearsarge.</p>
<p>As a researcher, one of my reasons for embarking was to get some 
understanding on how the Navy is engaging the New Media. After a week 
onboard I think I am able to make a few pedestrian observations.</p>
<p>First, the Navy is eager to engage the New Media. For the USS 
Kearsarge deployment, it was the Navy and not the New Media that first 
proposed inviting online journalists onboard. While onboard, the online 
journalists have had almost complete access to the ship and its crew. I 
have run across only two locations on the ship inaccessible to the 
online journalists. Everywhere else, from the bridge to engineering are 
open to journalists without restrictions on photography or reporting 
(besides OPSEC). As an anecdotal example, David Axe, online reporter for
 Wired.com, met the Commanding Officer of the Marine CH-53E squadron 
onboard and within a couple days David and myself were given a complete 
tour of the helicopter’s avionics on the flight deck during nighttime 
flight operations.</p>
<p>Second, there has been zero censorship of the New Media onboard. The 
online journalists on the Kearsarge are the responsibility of the Public
 Affairs Office (PAO). Nobody in the PAO or rest of the Navy clears the 
photographs or articles published by the online journalists. Throughout 
the deployment, the PAO has been commendably accommodating. The role of 
the PAO so far could best be described as “fixers”, arranging interviews
 and giving directions and tours when requested by New Media 
journalists.</p>
<p>Third, the Navy is still learning how to engage the New Media. This 
deployment represents the first time the New Media has been invited to 
report during a Navy operation and there were some major issues that 
came up, primarily internet access. The online journalists do not have 
the DoD login required to use the ship’s computers and cannot connect 
their own computers to the ship’s network. Thus, for the first couple 
days, the only way for the New Media to file stories was to ask 
servicemen to borrow their unclassified terminals for a few minutes. 
This point was the major frustration for the New Media since, by 
definition, they require sustained internet access. Personally, in the 
first two days the only thing I was able to accomplish online was an 
email to my wife (luckily research is less time sensitive than 
journalism).</p>
<p>However, the Navy has been quick to identify the problems of the New 
Media onboard and placed significant resources (and a great IT staff 
working almost around the clock) into resolving them. Regarding internet
 access, by the fifth day an “NGO Café” was opened in two rooms off the 
gym, complete with laptop computers and unrestricted internet access 
(something even the officers and crew do not enjoy). Since opening, 
everyone from the Commodore on down has stopped by the NGO Café to make 
sure the New Media is happy with the Café.</p>
<p>Did the Navy drop the ball at times? Absolutely. I have a laundry 
list of errors and problems in my notes. But, problems are bound to crop
 up when trying something new and the Navy’s New Media experiment is not
 (and should not be considered) exceptional. But throughout the seven 
days I have been onboard, the Navy has shown an impressive eagerness and
 willingness to engage the New Media, time and again bending rules to 
cater to the needs of the online journalists onboard.</p>

<p>The USS Kearsarge has an impressive medical facility onboard, second 
only to that of a hospital ship. However, the facility was designed to 
handle the combat casualties of a Marine Expeditionary Unit, not 
pediatric cleft pallet and cleft lip surgeries. I asked Commander 
Damstra, who was originally trained as a family physician, how the 
Kearsarge will handle pediatric surgery cases.</p>
<p>40-60 children are selected for the cleft pallet or cleft lip surgery
 by Operation Smile’s permanent team in Nicaragua months before the 
Kearsarge arrives in Puerto Cabezas. Additionally, the Kearsarge has 
worked with Operation Smile to get the NGO’s specialized pediatric 
equipment and supplies onboard.</p>
<p>The first day the Kearsarge arrives in Puerto Cabezas, the patients 
will gather at a local church. From there, they will re-evaluated and 
told which day they will be going onboard for the surgery, with patients
 requiring longer follow-up care going first. Each child will have an 
escort (normally a parent) and both will receive a chest x-ray (to test 
for TB) before being allowed onboard. Currently the plan is to fly 
patients onboard the Kearsarge via helicopter.</p>
<p>After the operation, all children will stay overnight (or as long as 
required) in the ward with their escorts. When the children are ready to
 disembark, they are given a complete, detailed copy of the medical 
records so that the children’s local doctor has a clear understanding of
 the procedure that took place.</p>
<p>In the long term, Operation Smile will conduct follow-ups with all 
patients one week, six months, and one year after the surgery.</p>

<p>The Wardroom on the USS Kearsarge is the officer’s cafeteria, 
conference room, lecture hall, 24 hour coffee house and social club for 
the officers, foreign militaries, and NGOs onboard the Kearsarge. 
However, the Wardroom’s most valuable function is more subtle: as a 
point of information exchange and social networking onboard the ship.</p>
<p>While the Kearsarge’s crew and riders total more than 1600, only 
around 500 (my guess) are involved in the humanitarian mission and 
almost all of them eat in the Wardroom. Every night personnel from 
different nationalities, services, and specialties eat together at the 
Wardroom’s communal tables. A typical table might include a Navy 
pediatrician, a Marine pilot, an NGO logistician, and an Army 
veterinarian.</p>
<p>The result is that, three times a day, people from disparate 
roles/organizations share information and perspectives over hot food. 
Through casual conversation,&nbsp;personnel are introduced to new and 
different aspects of the operation. Simply put, the Wardroom is possibly
 the greatest builder of intellectual capital on the ship.</p>
<p>Coordination and communication is going to be&nbsp;key determinants 
in the success of the Kearsarge’s mission. While individuals do have 
more formal interactions through briefings and meetings, the Wardroom 
provides a much welcome extra, efficient, and informal medium for 
exchanging information and building working relationships.</p>

<p>Greetings from the USS Kearsarge. We got underway less than 24 hours 
ago, so my observations of the mission are only cursory at this point. 
Two quick ones. First, the ship is packed with medical personnel. So 
far, I have seen and/or met medical personnel from the US Army, Navy, 
Air Force, Marine Copr, Coast Guard, US Health Service, Canada, 
Netherlands, Brazil, Operation Smile, and Operation Hope, all of whom 
spend a good deal of time wandering the halls lost. Second, although I 
had have no time to take a more complete look, the ship is full with 
construction equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>More to come…</p>

 on the targeting of aid agencies in Somalia. Aid groups in the country 
are increasingly being attacked and humanitarian operations have largely
 halted due to security concerns. The dangers of aid work come with the

robberies or mistaken identity, the attacks in Somalia, for political 
reasons, purposely strike against humanitarians.</p>

Radio [The Voice of Peace], July 14; Garowe Online, July 14). [Emphasis

<p>Insurgencies are contests for the minds and will of the population. 
In the eyes of insurgents, humanitarian organizations are competitors 
for the support of local populations. Thus, humanitarian NGOs and IGOs

<p>Any quantitative conflict researcher has heard of RAND’s Worldwide 
Terrorism Incident Database (RWTID). RWTID is one of the best sources of
 data on terrorism, the whole thing was web-accessible and well 
documented (like a Google for terrorist attacks). So, you can understand
 my annoyance when RAND took the database offline and now wants to start
 charging to access:</p>
<blockquote><p>On March 31, 2008, support for development and 
dissemination of the Worldwide Terrorism Incident Database lapsed, 
causing the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism to remove
 web-based search of that database from its website. Since then, RAND 
has received many requests for access to the data. RAND is exploring 
options for making the data available on a subscription basis. If you 
wish to subscribe to a web-based search engine accessing the database, 
please contact us. Until RAND concludes this inquiry, we will provide 
customized search results on a fee-for-service basis. To price such a 
search, please send us the details of your request, including the types 
of terrorist events you wish to search for, the countries you are 
searching, the time period over which the search should be run, and any 
particular key words (groups, weapons, targets, etc.) you may be 
searching for.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p>In 1989, Serbian forces dissolved the government of the local 
Kosovars and absorbed the Kosovar health system into the Serbian 
administration. This move dramatically limited access to healthcare for 
the people of Kosovo. Three years later, the Kosovo Liberation Army’s 
(KLA) increasingly violent clashes with Serbian forces highlighted the 
need for a Kosovar field health system, serving both combatants and 
civilians.</p>
<p>The article “<a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/amsus/zmm/2008/00000173/00000006/art00021">Field-Improvised War Surgery in Kosovo: Use of Kitchen Utensils as Surgical Instruments</a>”
 [gated] in the journal Military Medicine tells the compelling story of a
 Kosovar field hospital hidden in the Molopolce mountain region:</p>
<blockquote><p>The conflict in Kosovo left surgeons and medical 
personnel with limited supplies during a time of war. The field 
hospital, located in a three-story building in the Molopolce mountain 
range, consisted of one operating theater, one recovery room, one 
examination room, and a room where minor surgical procedures could be 
performed (Fig. 1). At the Nerodime field hospital, skilled surgeons had
 to resort to the use of simple kitchen utensils as tools in the 
operating theater. Utensils with handles of plastic were transformed 
into retractors and used during major abdominal operations (Fig. 2, 3). 
The concavity of tablespoons was taken advantage of, allowing these 
utensils to be employed as retractors during appendectomy procedures. A 
light used for theatrical stage shows was improvised and used to 
illuminate the surgical field during procedures at the field hospital.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to the main field hospital, the Kosovars established 
several second-line clinics consisting of one physician and three nurses
 working out of a private home. These clinics treated postoperative and 
minor wounded patients, thus increasing bed avalilablity in the main 
field hospital.</p>
<p>The incredible story of this make-shift health system in the Molopolce includes an equally dramatic ending.</p>
<blockquote><p>After a NATO air strike on Yugoslavia in March 1999, the 
Serbian campaign more aggressively bombarded the Molopolce mountain 
region. A Serbian operation was launched in the eastern and southern 
areas and advanced in the direction of the KLA-controlled area. 
Eventually, an emergency midnight evacuation of all medical staff, 
patients, and remaining medical equipment was necessary. This evacuation
 was accomplished on a footpath through the hills with doctors and other
 medical personnel carrying patients on hand stretchers to a previously 
established rendezvous point located in a cave.</p></blockquote>

 have been holding back mentioning anything until the details were 
finalized. However, as of this morning everything is set and confirmed. 
Therefore, I am pleased to announce <strong>I will be accompanying the</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Kearsarge_%28LHD-3%29"><strong>USS Kearsarge (LHD-3)</strong></a> <strong>for the first two weeks of her deployment as part of</strong> <a href="http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/factFiles.php?id=53"><strong>Operation Continuing Promise</strong></a><strong>, and (most importantly) taking War &amp; Health’s readers along for the ride!</strong></p>
<p>In early August, I will be blogging onboard the Wasp-class amphibious
 assault ship as it deploys to South America to provide humanitarian and
 medical assistance. Readers of War &amp; Health will get to see a US 
Navy humanitarian assistance mission from the inside. Is the USS 
Kearsarge equipped to be a floating hospital? How well does the US Navy 
interact with humanitarian NGOs? Does providing health care really win <a href="http://mountainrunner.us/2008/07/debunking_hearts_and_minds.html">minds and wills</a>? Is the US Navy an appropriate tool for delivering long term medical care? Are humanitarian deployments the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Fleet">white fleets</a>
 of the 21st century? Does Chris get sea-sick? All these questions and 
more will be tackled through daily (hopefully more) articles on War 
&amp; Health.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned to War &amp; Health, it is going to be one heck of a journey!</p>

 July 2nd, the Colombian military staged a stunning dupe, convincing 
FARC to hand over 15 hostages, including three Americans and Ingrid 
Betancourt, to a helicopter belonging to a fake humanitarian NGO. Today,
 CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/07/15/colombia.red.cross/index.html#cnnSTCText">described some unpublished</a> video taken during the rescue that included the name of the fake humanitarian organization the operation used as cover:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unpublished video also reveals an emblem that bears the Spanish 
words “Mision Internacional Humanitaria” (International Humanitarian 
Mission) and a stylized red bird made up of wavy red lines above two 
curved branches of blue leaves. In the 3½-minute video of the operation 
issued by the military, emblems pasted on the side of the rescue 
helicopter cannot be seen. But in the unpublished video and photos shown
 to CNN, emblems measuring about one square meter (one square yard) are 
pasted onto the outside of the chopper.</p>
<p>The same emblem appears on the Web site for Mision Internacional 
Humanitaria, which describes itself as a non-governmental organization 
based in Barcelona, Spain, that “works to improve the processes of 
development to guarantee equality of opportunity for individuals and 
peoples.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears the Colombian military even went so far as to setup a <a href="http://misionhi.org/">website for the fictional NGO</a>
 just in case FARC leaders googled it. However, luckily the FARC did not
 have even basic knowledge of domain names. Why? Because a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whois">whois query,</a>
 used to determine the owner of a domain name, reveals the the NGO’s 
domain name (Misionhi.org) was registered just six days before the 
rescue. If FARC did a whois search, something your son or daughter 
probably already knows how to do, the cover story of the NGO and perhaps
 the entire operation could have been blown.</p>

<p>Two comments regarding this blog.</p>
<p><strong>First, the good:</strong> I have been invited and have accepted an offer to become a contributor at the <a href="http://www.terraplexic.org/">Complex Terrain Laboratory Review</a>. We have a top notch team of bloggers at CTLab including Matt Armstrong of <a href="http://www.mountainrunner.us/">MountainRunner</a>, Christian Bleuer of <a href="http://easterncampaign.wordpress.com/">Ghosts of Alexander</a>, Drew Conway of <a href="http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/agc282/zia/">Zero Intelligence Agents</a>, Dave Dilegge of <a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/">Small Wars Journal</a>, Mark Safranski of <a href="http://zenpundit.com/?page_id=2">Zenpundit</a>, Tim Stevens of <a href="http://ubiwar.com/about-2/">Ubiwar</a>, Michael Tanji of <a href="http://haftofthespear.com/">Half of the Spear</a>, and Mike Innes. Expect great things from CTLab in the future.</p>
<p>What does this mean for readers of War &amp; Health? Nothing! War 
&amp; Health will always be my main place for publishing original and 
focused content on the interrelation of armed conflict and public 
health. The only thing changing is that, if you want to read <em>more</em> of me, you can find additional content available on CTLab.</p>
<p><strong>Second, the bad:</strong> I have my qualifying exams in 66 
days and as such I am unable to post as frequently as I would like. War 
&amp; Health will continue to have new and interesting articles each 
week, however the number of posts per week will be smaller for the next 
couple months. That is, posting will be consistent but less frequent.</p>
<p>That is all, carry on.</p>

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/israel-cluster.jpg" alt="israel_cluster" style="float:right;" height="430" width="350">I just got around to a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/lebanon0208/lebanon0208sumandrecs.pdf">Human Rights Watch report</a>
 on the use of cluster munitions during the Israel-Lebanon war. The map 
to the right appears in the report. Each red dot represents a cluster 
munition strike.</p>
<p>Throughout the war, Israeli artillery used relatively few cluster 
munitions. However, in the conflict’s final 72 hours Israel launched 
more than 800 cluster munition strikes into Southern Lebanon, around 90%
 of the total made during the conflict. I looked around for a good 
explanation for this dramatic change in strategy, but did not have much 
luck. I am not a military expert and so will let readers come to their 
own conclusions.</p>
<p>One parting fact, Human Rights Watch and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-cluster10-2008jul10,0,251960.story?track=rss">others</a>
 believe 25% of the Israeli submunitions (the little bombs dropped from 
the big bombs) malfunctioned, not exploding on impact, and litter the 
Lebanese countryside. The end result is that much of Southern Lebanon 
has been turned into ‘de facto landmine fields’, unusable for farming or
 herding.</p>

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/iraqwater.jpg" alt="iraqwater.jpg" style="float:right;" height="205" width="310">Bill Murray from The Long War Journal has a good article about a <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/07/water_distribution_s.php">new water distribution</a>
 site in Baghdad. The $400,000 water facility will provide free water to
 3,000 families and cover 60% of the need in the area. Two additional 
sites under construction will provide the remaining 40%. However, the 
most interesting fact about the facility is its location:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Water from the site, located within the walls of a US-operated 
Forward Operating Base, is then piped underneath the 15-foot-high 
reinforced concrete barriers surrounding the base to taps at a 
drive-through location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that community, Iraqis receive their water directly from a US FOB,
 a fact that speaks volumes about the securitization of services. 
Specifically, this is notable for two reasons. First, the placement of 
the water facility inside the FOB might very well discourage attacks, 
since an attack on the FOB is <em>also, literally</em> an attack on the 
community’s access to water. Second, the location gives US and Iraqi 
security forces full credit for providing the service. That is, the 
population physically visits the FOB to collect their water and knows 
clearly who provided it, winning hearts and minds. This point was 
apparently not lost on the Iraqi security forces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As services return to the area after many years of sanctions, neglect
 and civil unrest, police expect increased access to information about 
the Shia insurgency, because the area has been a haven for arms caches 
and terrorist cells associated with Muqtada al Sadr’s Madhi Army and 
Iranian trained “Special Groups.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Winning hearts and minds, gaining useful intelligence, and providing 
free, clean water to a poor community. That is a trio anyone can 
appreciate.</p>

 is a collection of seven essays describing the historical context, 
theoretical foundations, and development of human security as a concept.
 Kaldor argues the world is seeing the emergence of what she coins “new 
wars”, that is “… wars that take place in the context of the 
disintegrating of states… fought by networks of state and non-state 
actors… where most of the violence is directed against civilians” (pg. 
3). From this assumption she moves the reader through a series of 
logical steps, concluding with a new and unorthodox approach to human 
security and hence, the use of military force.</p>
<p>Kaldor’s first four essays lay out the historical context in which 
the modern debate over human security takes place. Specifically, the 
essays explore 1) a decade of intervention, 2) the american concept of 
power and compliance, 3) new nationalism, and finally 4) a case study of
 the Balkan intervention. The goal of these essays is to illustrate a 
new emerging concept of new wars where nationalism, informal combatants,
 and criminalized informal economies align to perpetuate conflict, and 
the American classic military doctrine is unprepared and ill equipped to
 face them.</p>
<p>Her next two essays build the theoretical foundations of human 
security. Chapter 5 follows the changing meaning of “global civil 
society” from ancient Greece to the present. The chapter holds an 
impassioned argument to “establish a set of global rules based on 
consent” (pg. 153), that is: global governance to minimize domestic and 
international violence. In Chapter 6, Kaldor tackles Just War doctrine. 
She argues new wars blur the distinction between international and 
domestic , combatant and non-combatant, and thus between war and peace, 
and in the face of this, “a new ethical approach is needed, grounded in 
the notion that the rights of individuals supersede the rights of states
 and that, therefore, international law that applies to individuals 
overrides the laws of war” (pg. 154-155), a concept she defines as “Just
 Peace”.</p>
<p>The real meat of Kaldor’s book lies in her final chapter. Here, she 
posits a new definition of security that “is about confronting extreme 
vulnerability not only in wars but in natural and man-made disasters…” 
(pg. 183) and a new definition of development that goes beyond improving
 standards of living to include “feeling safe on the streets or being 
able to influence political decision-making” (pg. 183). Based on these 
new definitions, she proposes five principles of human security: the 
primacy of human rights, legitimate political authority, 
multilateralism, the bottom-up approach, and regional focus.</p>
<p><strong>First, a human security approach places human rights above everything.</strong>
 Kaldor argues: “this principle means is that unless it is absolutely 
necessary and legal, killing is to be avoided. For the military it means
 the <em>primary goal of protecting civilians rather than defeating an adversar</em>y.
 Of course, sometimes it is necessary to try to capture or even defeat 
insurgents but this has to be seen as a means to an end, civilian 
protection, rather than the other way round. <em>So-called collateral damage is unacceptable</em>” (pg. 186). Furthermore, she argues gross human rights violations must be as “<em>individual criminals rather than collective enemies</em>” (pg. 186). [Emphasis mine]</p>
<p><strong>Second, human security requires institutions of political authority considered legitimate by local populations.</strong>
 Thus, gaining political legitimacy is a central goal in any operation. 
This requires a commander “who understands politics and has access to 
political authority” (pg. 188). I am in firm agreement with her on this 
point.</p>
<p><strong>Third, human security operations must include a commitment to
 1) work with international organizations, 2) create and enforce common 
rules, and 3) focus on coordination.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fourth, human security approaches must be bottom-up.</strong>
 That is, decisions in human security operations should be made in 
consultation with local populations. Regarding this, Kaldor takes a 
stance many operators would consider naive in the extreme: “the solution
 is to talk to everyone and it should not be so difficult to identify 
people with conscience and integrity who could act as local guides” (pg.
 189).</p>
<p><strong>Finally, a human security approach demands conflicts be examine at the regional, rather than state, level.</strong>
 She accurately argues new wars have no clear boundaries and thus 
restricting the focus to state-level perspectives makes us vulernable to
 epiphenonoma is neighboring states.</p>
<p>Overall, Kaldor’s book is an excellent and interesting perspective on
 human security, evidenced by the numerous “Wow!” comments I 
semiconsciously wrote in the margins. The last chapter contains her core
 argument. The middle five chapters are seemingly present only to 
(sometimes disjointedly) guide the reader to the logic she presents in 
the final chapter. Readers strapped for time could gain a good portion 
of the book’s worth by reading only the introduction and last chapter.</p>

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/uav-irrigation.jpg" alt="uav_irrigation.jpg" style="float:right;" height="350" width="350">Previously, I <a href="http://warandhealth.com/col-peter-mansoor-on-health-in-counterinsurgency-doctrine/">discussed the role of providing services</a>
 (health, education, sanitation, etc…) in counterinsurgency. After 
security, services represent a critical component in winning hearts and 
minds and strengthening the legitimacy of the state. With threats to 
personal security in Iraq on the decline (but still high), the provision
 of services is gaining increasing importance and this fact has not gone
 unnoticed by the US military.</p>
<p>Iraq contains a massive and intricate irrigation system of canals and
 pumping stations. The water it supplies and the flooding it controls 
are essential to the agriculturally dominated southern Iraq. Much of 
this canal system was left unusable after the initial 2003 invasion, 
either through direct damage or simply lack of maintenance. The fields 
the canal system supports are a sizable proportion of the Iraqi domestic
 economy.</p>
<p>The fact that a provisional reconstruction team (PRT) is repairing 
the irrigation canals and their pumping stations is mildly interesting, 
but nothing to write home about. However, what stands out is the fact 
that they are using a valuable security resource in <a href="http://www.dvidshub.net/index.php?script=news/news_show.php&amp;id=20709">an unorthodox way to do it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to help the GoI monitor and maintain the canals, 2nd BCT 
Soldiers came up with a high-tech solution. In addition to Soldiers 
performing foot patrols and SoI guarding key points, 2nd BCT Soldiers 
regularly keep a watch on the canals with unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
<p>“We’ve done this with every single canal,” Clegg said. “We had (the 
MoWR) supply us a map, showing the direction of flow. Then we stepped it
 up with UAV coverage. <strong>This actually allowed us to see where the water is flowing.</strong>” [Emphasis mine]</p>
<p>Clegg says the images are declassified and shown to MoRW officials every week to give them the information they need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply put, the PRT is using UAV surveillance flights to monitor the 
status of irrigation canal flows. This is the first example I have found
 of UAVs being used in a non-security function to improve services to 
Iraqi civilians. The use of UAVs, a much prized resource amongst 
commanders, hints at the new importance placed on providing services 
(particularly water); a ‘service surge’ if you will. It is also a 
reminder of the remarkable flexibility of the US military.</p>

<p>Infant mortality rates (the number of children younger than one year 
that die per 1000 live births) are incredibly sensitive to disruptions 
in society. Even a minor disturbance in a region’s economic, social, and
 political system can create a parallel, observable effect in infant 
mortality data. Two political scientists, M. Rodwan Abouharb of 
Louisiana State University and Anessa L. Kimball of Université Laval, 
offer one of the most comprehensive datasets on infant mortality rates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Systematic data on annual infant mortality rates are of use to a 
variety of social science research programs in demography, economics, 
sociology, and political science. Infant mortality rates may be used 
both as a proxy measure for economic development, in lieu of energy 
consumption or GDP-per-capita measures, and as an indicator of the 
extent to which governments provide for the economic and social welfare 
of their citizens. Until recently, data were available for only a 
limited number of countries based on regional or country-level studies 
and time periods for years after 1950. Here, the authors introduce a new
 dataset reporting annual infant mortality rates for all states in the 
world, based on the Correlates of War state system list, between 1816 
and 2002. They discuss past research programs using infant mortality 
rates in conflict studies and describe the dataset by exploring its 
geographic and temporal coverage. Next, they explain some of the 
limitations of the dataset as well as issues associated with the data 
themselves. Finally, they suggest some research areas that might benefit
 from the use of this dataset. This new dataset is the most 
comprehensive source on infant mortality rates currently available to 
social science researchers.</p>

possible, buildings dedicated to art, science, or charitable purposes, 
hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected provided

 many Iraqi insurgent attacks will occur next year causing 1 casualty? 
10 casualties? 200 casualties? How many FARC attacks will occur next 
year causing 30 casualties? How many Tamil Tiger attacks will occur next
 year causing 500 casualties? One <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/06/27/sciwar127.xml">very interesting research paper</a> just released argues it knows the answers, and finding them requires a simple number: 2.5.</p>
<p>The paper by Neil Johnson, Mike Spagat, Jorge Restrepo, Oscar 
Becerra, Juan Bohorquez, Nicolas Suarez, Elvira Restrepo, and Roberto 
Zarama argues modern insurgent attacks all obey the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a>.
 In plain english: in all modern insurgent conflict, attacks causing 
many casualties will occur with the same relative frequency to attacks 
causing few casualties. Simply by knowing the average number of attacks 
per year, the authors argue it is possible to predict the number of 
future attacks causing a certain number casualties in a future year.</p>
<p>Want to calculate your own predictions? It is easy: First, take the 
average number of attacks per year for the conflict. Second, select a 
level of attack deadliness (number of casualties) you want to predict. 
Third, plug them into the formula below.</p>
<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/eqn2235.jpg" alt="eqn2235.png" height="19" width="480"></p>
<p>For example, imagine a conflict with an average of 1000 insurgent 
attacks per year and we want to calculate how many attacks will cause 10
 casualties in a future year:</p>
<p>
<img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/1000.jpg" alt="1000.gif" height="20" width="199"></p>
<p>The model predicts slightly over 3 attacks causing 10 casualties will occur in a one year period.</p>
<p>Are the authors correct? I have no idea, but it is a very interesting
 approach to an important question. If you want to know more, check out <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news67524254.html">this Physorg article</a> containing a link to the original paper (might be gated).</p>

<p>I am a first generation American from Zimbabwean parents, and so the 
recent events in Zimbabwe have had a particular personal significance. 
On April 29th, the Times Online reported on the growing evidence 
Zimbabwean government officials, including the Minister of Health, are <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article3835622.ece">using the nation’s health system to facilitate violence against opposition supporters</a>.
 Accusations include using hospital grounds for political rallies, 
threatening physicians treating opposition victims of violence, raiding 
medical wards, and seizing patient lists. Opposition members have 
reportedly resorted to seeking treatment at sympathetic private clinics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As evidence of increasing government-sponsored violence against the 
Zimbabwean opposition mounts a pattern is emerging of deliberate 
attempts to obstruct medical treatment for its victims and to cover up 
the violence. The Zimbabwean Minister of Health and other doctors who 
are linked to the ruling party have been implicated in orchestrating the
 violence and using government medical facilities for their activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US Ambassador to Zimbabwe James McGee (my new hero) experienced 
this first hand in May when himself and other diplomats were detained 
for 45 minutes after visiting hospitals outside the capital to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/world/africa/14zimbabwe.html?scp=1&amp;sq=mcgee&amp;st=nyt">document violence against opposition supporters</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The diplomats involved in the incident at a roadblock on the edge of 
the capital, Harare, had just completed a tour of hospitals and an 
alleged torture camp when police demanded they prove they had official 
permission to visit the sites.</p>
<p>At one point, a police officer threatened to beat one of Mr. McGee’s 
senior aides. The officer got into his car and lurched toward Mr. McGee 
after he had demanded the officer’s name. The car made contact with Mr. 
McGee’s shins, but he was not injured.</p>
<p>Mr. McGee climbed onto the hood of the car while his aide snatched 
the keys from the ignition, then the diplomats used their mobile phone 
cameras to take photographs of the officer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zimbabwe’s healthcare system is already in <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0530/p06s01-woaf.html">deep trouble</a> and these reports do not make me hopeful for the country’s health prospects in the future.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/agc282/zia/"><strong>Zero Intelligence Agents</strong></a>
 – What does political science, mathematics, and programming have in

NYU, Drew blogs on the type of quantitative social science research I 
have fallen in love with. Think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Revised-Expanded-Economist-Everything/dp/0061234001%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dadriaantijsse-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0061234001">Freakonomics</a> for national security.

 are innovators in the conflict blogosphere and all are on my 
feedreader. Their group blog, CTLab, looks at conflict research through 
the lense of digital media. What does that mean to you? It means an 
approach to understanding conflict you have never seen before.</p>

<p>Political scientist Nicole Suveges was <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20080625006032&amp;newsLang=en">killed in a bombing inside Sadr City on Tuesday</a>. Suveges was part of the US military’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_terrain_system">Human Terrain System</a>, supporting U.S. Army’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team (BCT).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are deeply saddened by the loss of Nicole Suveges,” said Doug 
Belair, president of the company’s Technology Solutions &amp; Services 
(TSS) line of business. “She came to us to give freely of herself in an 
effort to make a better world. Nicole was a leading academic who studied
 for years on how to improve conditions for others. She also believed in
 translating what she learned into action. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with her family, friends and colleagues.”</p>
<p>Suveges began her current tour in Iraq in April of this year. Before 
joining BAE Systems, she had worked in Iraq for one year as a civilian 
contractor. Previously, Suveges served as a U.S. Army reservist in 
Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, supporting the multinational SFOR/NATO 
Combined Joint Psychological Operations Task Force.</p>
<p>She held a Master of Arts in political science from The George 
Washington University. Suveges was soon to complete her Ph.D. in 
political science with an emphasis on international relations from Johns
 Hopkins University, where she also served as managing editor for the 
“Review of International Political Economy.” Her dissertation was on 
“Markets &amp; Mullahs: Global Networks, Transnational Ideas and the 
Deep Play of Political Culture.” She presented numerous papers to 
international relations organizations and served as a graduate teaching 
assistant.</p>
<p>During her time with the 3rd BCT, she brought a wealth of skill and 
knowledge to support the mission in Iraq. Her experience in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, coupled with her academic credentials contributed 
materially to the success of the brigade in reducing the level of 
violence in the local community and in improving critical 
infrastructure. She worked closely with her HTS team members to help 
Iraqis achieve peace, stability and prosperity.</p>

<p>Rest in peace Nicole.</p>
<p>Update: HTS website has <a href="http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/In%20Memoriam.htm">updates</a>.</p>
<p>Update 2: Nicole Suveges on HTS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTS is the first effort to make social scientists and other HTT 
personnel available at the brigade – read local – level. This is where 
the war in Iraq is being fought, and it is about time that they are 
afforded the same capabilities that their higher echelons have.</p>

<p>I could not agree more.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;" src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/healthcliniciraq.jpg" alt="healthcliniciraq.jpg" height="204" width="350">Today,
 the Combined Arms Center’s Inter Agency Symposium is taking place. The 
purpose of the gathering is admirable and ambitious:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has become apparent that success in Twenty-first 
Century Warfare requires a “whole of government” or unified approach. 
The nation must utilize all elements of National Power to ensure victory
 in this era of persistent conflict. Over the next two days, members 
from across our government will meet to discuss these issues. It 
promises to be an insightful and spirited debate which will create a 
clearer picture for the way ahead as we conduct complex stability and 
support operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The symposium is being <a href="http://usacac.army.mil/BLOG/blogs/cac/archive/2008/06/23/live-blog-from-the-combined-arms-center-inter-agency-symposium.aspx">liveblogged</a>
 and yesterday they solicited questions through the internet for the 
panel to answer. Able to see an opportunity when presented to me on a 
silver platter, I submitted the following question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the notion of a “whole of government” approach,
 what role does the provision of health services play in ensuring 
victory in future conflicts?</p></blockquote>
<p>Very kindly, panelist Dr. Stephen Redd, <del datetime="2009-11-16T19:51:54+00:00">Naval</del> USPHS Officer and Director of Pandemic Influenza Surveillance Unit, responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Providing healthcare is very important in all operations 
including stability operations. By caring for the health of the 
populance, a government shows it is responsive to the basic needs of its
 people. In addition, the provision of healthcare gives people 
confidence in their government. Most stability operations take place in 
states that are weak or failing. One definition of a failing state is 
its inability to provide for the needs of its people. Hence, by 
providing healthcare, a state begins to strengthen and demonstrate its 
ability to reverse some of the trends that led it to become a weak or 
failed state in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Redd’s response is excellent and demonstrates a firm 
understanding of the dynamics between health services and political 
stability. I agree whole heartedly. To win hearts and minds, governments
 must prove themselves as legitimate institutions. The provision of 
health services is a key opportunity to gain that legitimacy in a 
value-added, cost-effective manner. Hopefully, through more discussions 
like the CAC’s IA symposium, health services will take a more prominent 
role in future stability operations.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks to Kris Harris for spotting our error regarding Redd’s affiliation.</p>

<p>Last friday at 9:30pm local time, a Taliban suicide bomber detonated 
his vehicle at the gate of Kandahar city’s Sarposa prison. Following the
 blast, <a href="http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=79cd32b5-bad3-49ff-b0a9-dd6567dd6f4c">witnesses report</a>
 30 motorcycles entered the breach and blew a second hole in the rear 
wall of the prison. During the following firefight nine hundred 
prisoners escaped.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/dodcmsshare/BloggerAssets/2008-05/05060810210920080506_ColMcGrath_bio.pdf">Colonel Thomas J. McGrath</a>
 of the Afghanistan Regional Security Integration Command – South 
(ARSIC-South), attended a Department of Defense Blogger’s Roundtable 
this morning to discuss the aftermath of last week’s prison break in 
Kandahar. You can listen to the entire conference call <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/DODCMSShare/BloggerAssets/2008-06/06230814573620080623_ColMcGrath_audio.mp3">here</a>.
 Significant to this blog, according to Col. McGrath the prison break 
has had no immediate effect on humanitarian, MEDCAP, or PRT programs. 
That is good news, however I worry the increased Taliban presence in the
 region might disrupt the programs in the future. Nevertheless, Col. 
McGrath was confident in the ability of Afghan and Coalition forces not 
to be derailed by the prison break, “We are making a lot of progress 
here.”</p>
<p>We wish him luck.</p>

 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are well placed to tackle the 
problem through medical and public health services. Many of these 
organizations have been dealing with HIV for decades. They have the 
resources and experience to make a great, positive difference. However, 
in the case of Karamoja there is not much anyone can do.</p>
<p>Karamoja is the Afghanistan of Africa: tribal, pastoral, violent, and
 without infrastructure. Government control, let alone health services, 
in the region is minimal. In this environment NGOs have been largely 
forced out by instability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most aid organisations function with only essential personnel on the 
ground, if at all, because of the region’s insecurity – cattle raids on 
neighbouring communities are common, and increasingly fatal with the 
introduction of modern arms – while the difficulty of travelling between
 districts forces non-governmental organisations (NGOs) either to manage
 their programmes in Karamoja remotely or give the region a wide berth.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We can’t invest more money because of the limited capacity for 
absorption; loads of money can go into Karamoja, but if no 
infrastructure or conducive policy environment is built, then the 
possibilities are limited,” said Savio Carvalho, Oxfam’s country 
programme manager. “There needs to be a framework.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carvalho is talking about system disruption. The roads, energy, 
social services , security, political control, and social network of a 
region are all part of its ‘system’. Conflicts disrupt these systems. 
The role of IGOs/NGOs is to repair or strengthen areas of systems 
through various methods. These include building new infrastructures 
(wells, clinics, schools) and providing health services. The problem in 
Karamoja is that the region’s system is below the threshold necessary 
for NGOs to operate. NGOs are designed to build upon existing systems, 
not create them from scratch. Carvalho refers to the existing system as 
the needed “framework”.</p>
<p>HIV health services are particularly vulnerable to system disruption.
 Antiretrovirals (ARVs), which make HIV a chronic (opposed to fatal) 
disease, must be taken regularly for the entire lifespan of the patient.
 When the system is disrupted (through road blocks, population 
movements, looting, etc…) and access to ARVs is interrupted, there is 
the very real risk the virus will become resistant to the treatment. 
Thus, ARVs are highly dependent on a stable system enabling the 
medical/logistical operation required to deliver and distribute the 
drugs throughout the region.</p>
<p>The takeaway point: The provision of health services requires a 
certain level of ‘system’ in place. When conflict is the primary 
disruptor of a region’s system, the ability to provide long term 
security (either from national or international sources) is a 
prerequisite to successful health interventions.</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p>A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending a talk given by 
Colonel Peter Mansoor. Col. Mansoor is a member of Petreus’ inner circle
 and has been influential in the development of the US Army’s 
counterinsurgency doctrine. Mansoor is also an architect of the surge 
strategy in Iraq and recently published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=030014069X%26tag=adriaantijsse-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/Baghdad-Sunrise-Brigade-Commanders-Military/dp/030014069X%3FSubscriptionId=0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2">Baghdad at Sunrise: A Brigade Commander’s War in Iraq</a>, an analysis of counterinsurgency in Iraq from a mid-level officer.</p>
<p>During the questions and answer section I asked the Colonel what was 
the role of providing health and social services in modern 
counterinsurgency doctrine. He took the (very reasonable) position that 
the primary concern of civilian populations is security. That is, 
without security, nothing else matters. However, once a certain level of
 security has been established, the population looks for the provision 
of services (including health services). In this ‘second stage’, of 
counterinsurgency the provision of health services plays a major role in
 winning hearts and minds. Mansoor’s position is that Iraq was just 
barely in this second stage.</p>
<p>I agree with Mansoor, but believe the effect is more nuanced. The two
 stages (security and services) are not firmly separated. Rather, as the
 population gradually feels less security needs, people begin to look 
for the provision of services.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  This dataset on Afghan towns and villages exposed to hostilities after
 11 September 2001 is the by-product of a landmine and UXO contamination
 assessment. The assessment, with a view to creating an inventory of 
freshly contaminated sites for rapid clearance purposes, was done by the
 Afghan NGO Mine Clearance Planning Agency (MCPA) with the help of the 
Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF), an advocacy and victim 
assistance organization in humanitarian mine action (Benini &amp; 
Donahue, 2003).
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>
  In spring and early summer 2002, MCPA interviewer teams visited all 
communities suspected to have been subject to airstrikes or ground 
operations during Operation Enduring Freedom. These communities – 
villages or urban neighborhoods – had been nominated by provincial 
administrations and by neighboring communities; moreover, MCPA had 
access to coalition airstrike imprints. The teams visited 747 suspect 
communities, among which exactly 600 were determined to have had at 
least one airstrike or ground operation. These affected communities were
 scattered in 102 districts in 25 of the 32 provinces.
</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>
  In each community confirmed exposed to post-9/11 hostilities, a team 
would conduct an interview, using a modular questionnaire, with a small 
group of local key informants. These groups, variable in size and 
composition, would share information on dates and types of hostilities, 
prewar and current population, old and new contaminated areas and broad 
types of munitions, types and numbers of property damaged or destroyed, 
and finally, victims. Victim numbers were elicited, broken down in 
several dimensions – by age and sex, cause (direct violence vs. landmine
 and unexploded ordnance strikes), outcome (deaths and injuries) – as 
well as two periods of time. Counts were requested of all who had come 
to harm between 11 September 2001 and the date of survey – a 9-month 
period on average. Retrospective counts were requested for the period of
 12 months prior to 9/11. No attempt was made to attribute the violence 
that caused these victims to any specific parties to the conflict. 
Before leaving the community, teams took GPS (Global Positioning System)
 measurements of the coordinates of a central location such as its 
mosque.

 The book explores the manipulation of the international refugee regime 
(i.e. UNHCR, NGOs, States hosting refugees, etc…) by warring parties. 
That is, the strategic creation and/or use of refugee camps in armed 
conflict:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hence some refugee camps become a breeding ground for 
refugee warriors: disaffected individuals, who-with the assistance of 
overseas diasporas, host governments, and interested states–equip 
themselves for battle to retrieve an idealized, mythical lost community.
 Facing military defeat at home, the warring party uses the suffering of
 refugees for its own political purpose: to siphon off aid, establish 
the international legitimacy of their cause, and, by manipulating access
 to them, ensure that they will not repatriate. As long as armies 
control refugee populations, they can demand a seat in negotiations.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the authors point out, the answer to refugee manipulation is in 
changing the incentives. That is, incentivizing and empowering 1) states
 hosting refugee camps to maintain control and security, 2) refugee 
leaders to reject armed groups militarizing camps, and 3) NGOs to 
prevent the maldistribution of their aid.</p>

 into Baghdad’s Sadr City today after a compromise with firebrand cleric
 Moktada al-Sadr. Most commentary focused on the impressive showing of 
the Iraqi Army, which conducted the operation largely independently. 
However, I (and also Dr. iRack from Abu Muqawama) noticed something 
else:</p>
<blockquote><p>By late Tuesday, Iraqi troops had pushed deep into the 
district and set up positions around hospitals and police stations, 
which the Iraqi government was seeking to bring under its control.</p></blockquote>
<p>A primary target for Iraqi forces seems to have been the facilities 
providing health services in the area. In the recent weeks Al-Sadr’s 
militia has tried to use ownership of these services to gain support 
amongst the population. Now with Iraqi forces firmly in control of Sadr 
City’s hospitals, it is a race against time to expand and improve 
available health services to win the support and loyalty of local 
residents.</p>
<p><a href="http://abumuqawama.blogspot.com/2008/05/taking-plunge-ia-enters-sadr-city.html">Dr. Irack put it well</a>:
 “[counterinsurgency] is a contest to influence and control the 
population”. The provision of health services is a low cost, yet 
powerful, approach to winning that contest. Those providing health 
services have a significant advantage in winning hearts, minds, and 
legitimacy in the population. By providing services, the government is 
aligning itself with the population’s interest. From then on, insurgent 
attacks are not simply a strike by one side against another, but an 
attack&nbsp; against the providers of the population’s health. In turn, 
the population is more willing to cooperate with local security forces 
in routing out insurgents and sympathizers. If in counterinsurgency 
populations are the battlefields, then hospitals are part of the 
commanding heights.</p>

<p>This morning I attended a blogger’s roundtable with US Air Force 
Captain Trevor Hall. Capt. Hall was the pilot-in-command for the first 
US military humanitarian flight into Burma since the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=burma+disaster">disaster</a>.
 His C-130 transport aircraft carried food, water, and medical supplies 
into Rangoon International Airport. Since then, a number of further US 
Air Force and Marine flights have taken place.</p>
<p>Capt. Hall described the Burmese military personnel offloading the 
plane as “ecstatic” for US help, some even wanting to have their 
pictures taken with the crew and aircraft. Hearing this, I was reminded 
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Halvorsen">Operation Little Vittles</a>,
 when US pilots participating in the Berlin Airlift dropped candy from 
their aircraft while flying over the city. The actions of the pilots won
 the hearts and minds of a generation of Berliners, who dubbed the 
aircraft “<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosinenbomber">Rosinenbombers</a>” (Candy Bombers), and still remember the act today.</p>
<p>The operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have proven the power in 
winning a population’s hearts and minds. Modern humanitarian airlifts 
represent not only a chance to fulfill our responsibility to humanity, 
but also to create an entire generation with fond memories of American 
aircraft dropping American aid. In the long term, the resulting support 
might pay back hundreds of times over.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/05/roundtable-aid.html">Blackfive</a> has a recording of the entire interview.</p>

 on young women in one of Africa’s longest conflicts, between the Joseph
 Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army and the Ugandan government. The LRA is 
the definition of brutality: routinely targeting civilians, <a href="http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=510">attacking aid convoys</a>, <a href="http://www.ugandacan.org/index.php?itemid=654">practicing mutilations</a>, and <a href="http://www.iwpr.net/?p=acr&amp;s=f&amp;o=336403&amp;apc_state=hENfacr336525">abducting adults and children</a> to swell their ranks.</p>
<p>Chris’ report contains many insights and is a fascinating read, but 
one particular point stands out: the role of abducted women in the LRA. 
Male abductees are primarily used as expendable troops and it has 
typically been assumed captive women are used as sexual slaves and 
forced wives for LRA officers. However, the report finds the vast 
majority of female LRA abductees are used in combat support roles with 
almost two thirds of women employed as porters or cooks. Only 7.5% of 
returned abductees reported being “wives” of LRA members and 7.4% used 
primarily for childcare.</p>
<p>The statistics offer a rare glimpse of the LRA as a rational, 
functioning organization requiring significant human resources to 
perform essential combat support duties rather than their more common, 
but simplistic portrayal as madmen.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/hospital-strike.jpg" alt="hospital-strike.jpg" height="363" width="480"></div>
<p>At approximately 10:00am on May 3rd, the United States <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/world/middleeast/04iraq.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">fired three precision-guided weapons at a small building</a> next to Sadr General Hospital in the Sadr City slum of Baghdad. The building is alleged by coalition forces to be a “<a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19027&amp;Itemid=21">criminal element command and control center</a>“.
 The first munition struck the small building, the second struck the 
hospital’s ambulance parking lot and broke the hospital’s water line, 
and the third hit a generator used by the neighborhood but not the 
hospital.</p>
<p>McClatchy’s Leila Fadel and Shashank Bengali <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/shashank_bengali/story/35794.html">described</a> the damage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sadr Hospital, one of two main hospitals serving the 
massive Shiite Muslim slum, is operating on a backup water supply that 
wasn’t expected to last longer than 48 hours. On Sunday afternoon, a 
main street outside the hospital was flooded as workmen tried to repair a
 series of underground pipes that ruptured when the missiles targeted 
what U.S. military officials described as a militia outpost a few yards 
from the hospital.</p>
<p>“If there are no more attacks, we might be able to fix it. We don’t 
know,” said a hospital security official who gave his name as Abu 
Sajjad. “Otherwise, in two days we will run out of water and the 
hospital can’t go on.”</p>
<p>The official said that the U.S. strike also damaged 15 ambulances and
 forced many hospital staff to flee. Not everyone returned to work 
Sunday, leaving a Spartan emergency ward nearly empty of doctors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The airstrike betrays an understandable ignorance in coalition forces
 towards the nature of health care delivery. While coalition forces 
avoid targeting hospitals directly, this does not protect the ability of
 the hospital to function. The rational for not striking hospitals is to
 keep them operating and providing health to the local population. 
However, any hospital’s functions are reliant on a large network of 
facilities and services. This network includes ambulance facilities and 
water lines. Most of these network nodes exist outside the hospital’s 
physical perimeter and whose presence is not calculated into airstrike 
planning. If policy makers truly want to maintain access to healthcare 
during armed conflict they must consider not only the hospital’s 
physical facilities but also key nodes in the area’s health care 
network, regardless of whether or not they fly the red cross.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;" src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/sadrcity.jpg" alt="sadrcity.jpg" height="197" width="300">Last
 month, American and Iraqi forces launched a major push into the Sadr 
City section of Baghdad. The operations led to intense fighting and 
crippled Sadr City’s already flimsy infrastructure. As a result, large 
swaths of Sadr City are currently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/world/middleeast/22sadrcity.html?_r=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=6709e4618b3f0253&amp;ex=1366603200&amp;oref=slogin&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print">without trash collection, sewer systems, electricity, food, and access to health services.</a></p>
<p>The situation in Sadr city represents not only a humanitarian 
disaster, but also a direct threat to winning hearts and minds. Michael 
Gordon, in his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/world/middleeast/22sadrcity.html?_r=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=6709e4618b3f0253&amp;ex=1366603200&amp;oref=slogin&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print">New York Times article</a>, points out the problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Saturday, three Sadr City residents gingerly 
approached an American Army position to deliver a warning: Unless the 
Iraqi government or its American partner did something to restore 
essential services and remove the piles of garbage, the militias would 
gain more support.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Through a ‘Hezbollah-like’ scheme, the Shiite Sadrist movement has 
established itself as the main service provider in the country,” notes a
 recent report by Refugees International, an advocacy group. “As a 
result of the importance of nonstate actors in the delivery of 
assistance and security, civilians are joining militias.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The lack of infrastructure, sanitation, and health services offer 
opportunities for militias to move quickly, winning hearts and minds by 
merely providing token services to residents. While the Iraqi government
 can provide greater levels of support, militias can provide support <span style="font-style: italic;">right now</span>.
 For example, the Iraqi government is promising $150 million to bolster 
Sadr City’s infrastructure, however, it will not do so until the 
security situation improves. The speed of the Sadrists allows them to 
compete against the Iraqi government for public support at a fraction of
 the cost. That is, in the battle for hearts and minds, $100 today is 
worth more than a $10,000 a year from now.</p>

<p>UNOSAT <a href="http://unosat.web.cern.ch/unosat/asp/prod_free.asp?pid=1170">gives us a snapshot</a>
 of the security situation in Mogadishu since the Transitional Federal 
Government and Ethiopian forces captured the capital in December 2006. 
The data comes from news reports from the Shabelle Media Network (SMN), 
Garowe Online (GO), SomaliNet (SN), East African Standard (EAS), The 
Nation (Nairobi), Kenya Times, Reuters, BBC, AP, AFP, Washington Post 
&amp; Aljazeera. I’ll hand it off to UNOSAT for a more detailed 
description. Click the image for the full map in PDF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This map provides an overview of the reported security events in 
Mogadishu since the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and allied 
Ethiopian forces took control of the capital on 29 December 2006. 
Security events have been classified according to the type of weapon 
used: 1-mortars; 2-rocket propelled grenades (RPG); 3-hand grenades; and
 4-small arms. Urban areas with increasing concentrations of security 
events (“hot spots”) have been highlighted with a color scale increasing
 from blue to red. This intensity image has also been weighted by the 
type of weapon used, giving prominence to mortars and RPG-based events. 
Each point symbol represents a specific event in a given location and 
time. In those instances when multiple mortar shells fell in a specific 
area on the same day (e.g. 4 mortars fell at the Airport) a single event
 point symbol was assigned. The spatial accuracy of most points is 
within 100m of the true location; however a significant minority of 
events have large degrees of uncertainly and may be accurate only to 
within a few kilometers. All security-related information used in this 
analysis has been acquired exclusively from public media sources. The 
security events depicted on this map have not been independently 
verified on the ground nor are they likely representative of all 
security and humanitarian events in this area. Casualty figures recorded
 for each security event are also likely to be significant 
underestimates. All security-related data collection, analysis and map 
production has been done by UNOSAT to help provide the humanitarian 
community with a spatial context to the ongoing security events in 
Mogadishu.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;" src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/ugandanarmy.jpg" alt="ugandanarmy.jpg" height="199" width="300">When
 discussing the relationship between HIV/AIDS and developing world 
militaries, some statements are generally accepted as fact. First, there
 is a higher HIV/AIDS prevalence amongst military services&nbsp; than 
amongst comparable civilians. Second, HIV/AIDS prevalence cripples the 
ability of the armed forces to conduct their duties. Third, war spreads 
HIV/AIDS. Fourth, HIV/AIDS is a threat to national security. In a <a href="http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/105/419/201">2006 journal article</a>, Alan Whiteside, Alex de Waal, and Tsadkan Gebre-Tensae analyzed these four accepted wisdoms in African militaries.</p>
<h3>1. Do soldiers have higher HIV prevalence?</h3>
<p>Whiteside, de Waal, and Gebre-Tensae conclude HIV/AIDS prevalence in 
militaries is determined by two competing factors. First, young recruits
 typically have less HIV prevalence than the general population, driving
 down the overall prevalence. Second, older servicemen often have higher
 prevalence than the source civilian population raising prevalence. 
These factors work against each other, with the latter likely having 
more sway. Thus, the statement that militaries typically have three or 
four times the HIV/AIDS prevalence than civilians is unlikely.</p>
<h3>2. Does HIV/AIDS undermine military effectiveness?</h3>
<p>On this point the authors argue HIV/AIDS could -and likely (in the 
case of Uganda) has- undermined military effectiveness. However, 
militaries are specifically structured to absorb losses and built in 
redundancies likely negate most negative effects of HIV/AIDS losses.</p>
<h3>3. Does war contribute to the spread of HIV?</h3>
<p>Against this point the authors argue there is not the data to support
 it either way. Specifically they argue that since Rwanda was the only 
example of HIV/AIDS used as a weapon, the military use of HIV/AIDS is 
essentially an anomaly. That is, armed conflict spreading HIV/AIDS is 
the exception, not the rule.</p>
<h3>4. Does HIV/AIDS imperil national security?</h3>
<p>The authors argue the connection between HIV/AIDS and political 
instability is inconclusive. High HIV/AIDS prevalence is correlated with
 a number of other factors likely contributing to political instability.
 With this in mind, it is impossible to claim HIV/AIDS is a cause of 
instability any more than other factors.</p>
<p>My point in highlighting this article is not to argue it either way, but to make a simple assertion: <span style="font-style: italic;">political science and public health lack even basic understanding of the interrelationship between armed conflict and HIV/AIDS</span>. That is, there is work to be done.</p>

<p>In 1798, Thomas Malthus made a parsimonious, albeit depressing, 
argument that population growth will eventually outpace agricultural 
production. Luckily that point has never been reached thanks to 
improvements in agricultural productivity. Today, the malthusian 
catastrophe is limited to science fiction and Econ 101 classes. However,
 was Malthus right after all? <img style="float:right;" src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/corncombineandtank.jpg" alt="corncombineandtank.jpg" height="233" width="350"></p>
<p>One reporter might think so. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the Telegraph <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/04/14/ccview114.xml">recently argued</a>
 that concerns over global warming have produced a surge in use of corn 
for ethanol. He argues this trend is driving up the price of food 
everywhere.</p>
<p>Will rising prices spark future food wars? Atleast one academic leaves the possibility open. In his book, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collapse</span>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond">Jared Diamond</a> offers the second <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54778-2005Jan6.html">most fascinating perspective</a> on the Rwandan genocide I have heard to date:</p>
<blockquote><p>Diamond observes that pre-genocide Rwanda had a 
population density approaching that of Holland, supported by Stone Age 
agriculture: In the years preceding the genocide, Rwanda suffered a 
precipitous decline in per capita food production because of drought and
 overworked soil, which in turn caused massive deforestation. The upshot
 was dramatically rising levels of theft and violence perpetrated by 
landless and hungry young men. Diamond quotes a French scholar on East 
Africa, Gerard Prunier: “The decision to kill was of course made by 
politicians, for political reasons. But at least part of the reason why 
it was carried out so thoroughly by the ordinary rank-and-file peasants .
 . . was feeling that there were too many people on too little land, and
 that with a reduction in their numbers, there would be more for the 
survivors.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So, should you start stockpiling ammo and cans of tuna for a global 
food war? Not unless you like casserole. First, global hunger is not so 
much caused by insufficient production but from our inability to 
distribute it effectively. Humanity grows enough calories but cannot get
 it to the people who need it. Second, while the article is a good read,
 the real problem is more subtle than blaming Al Gore. The rise in food 
prices is likely caused more by fuel prices than ethanol. Oil prices 
have risen dramatically in recent years and the cost is being transfered
 to customers, some of which cannot afford it. Finally, the recent “food
 riots” are a symptoms of greater problems, including economic and 
political instability. That is, we will need more than bags of flour to 
get out of this mess.</p>

<p>In one developing country the military was disbanded after the end of
 a brutal dictatorial regime. For the last few years security has been 
provided primarily through international forces. Now these forces are 
considering leaving, and the people are understandably nervous. This 
country is not Iraq, but Liberia.</p>
<p>For the last two years this small African state, previously host to one of the continent’s most brutal civil wars, has been <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-04-14-voa40.cfm?rss=war%20and%20conflict">building a new army</a>.
 The growing force is trying to shake off the reputation of past human 
rights violations, partially through higher recruiting standards.</p>
<p>However, this is not your typical mustering of the troops. First, the
 training of the new army is conducted by private military contractors, 
paid by the United States. It is hoped these contractors will be able to
 construct a modern, professional, and human rights capable security 
force. Second, the training is part of the United Nation’s endgame in 
Liberia. The UN argues it cannot have a permanent presence in the state 
and eventually security will have to be the responsibility of the 
Liberians themselves. That is, as the Liberian army and police stand up,
 the UN will sit down. Third, the army will, according to Defense 
Minister Brownie Samukai, have a “cardinal principle” that “[n]ot one 
inch of Liberian territory will be used to destablize our neighbors…”. 
This goal will likely make Liberia’s neighbors sleep better at night, 
though likely classic realist scholar less so.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, the undertaking in Liberia begs the question: Does 
the future of sustainable, cost effective human security come from 
international forces, domestic forces, or a hybrid of both?</p>

 When I started as a research assistant, my advisor offered three simple
 pieces of advice: “Get the data, get the data, get the data”.  For all 
the advances in the technique and popularity of quantitative research 
methods, obtaining the actual data remains haphazard. Some seemingly 
public data have an almost&nbsp; mythical ability to avoid being 
accessed. Often the only way to obtain the data used in a published work
 is to email the author and beg. However, things <a href="http://data.un.org/">are looking up</a>, at least at the UN:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new UN data access system will improve the 
dissemination of statistics by UNSD to the widest possible audience. An 
easy to use data access system was developed that meets UNSD’s vision of
 providing an integrated information resource with current, relevant and
 reliable statistics free of charge to the global community.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new site offers a google-ish interface to explore the UN’s vast 
datasets and will be a welcome tool for quantitative researchers.</p>

<p><a href="http://mountainrunner.us/">Matt Armstrong</a> (AKA 
MountainRunner) has been publishing a blogging tour de force during the 
last few weeks and has established himself as the most prominent voice 
on public diplomacy in the blogosphere. If you are not reading his blog 
yet, here are four posts that will convince you otherwise:</p>
<h2></h2>
<h3><a href="http://mountainrunner.us/2008/02/africom_doa_or_just_bad_market.html">AFRICOM: DOA or in Need of Better Marketing? No and Yes.</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://mountainrunner.us/2008/02/africom_doa_or_just_bad_market.html"> </a></p>
<blockquote><p>Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">Mark Twain’s</a> “death” in <a href="http://www.twainquotes.com/Death.html">1897</a> (he died in 1910), reports of AFRICOM’s demise may be exaggerated.  Concerns that AFRICOM <a href="http://softpowerbeacon.blogspot.com/2008/02/africom-rip.html">hasn’t been thought out</a> or is <a href="http://hiddenunities.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/africom-is-doa-pt-1/">unnecessary</a> aren’t supported by the actions and statements of those charged with building this entity.  However, based on the poor <em>marketing</em> of AFRICOM, these concerns are not surprising.</p>
<p>I attended <a href="http://mountainrunner.us/2008/01/upcoming_events_on_africa.html">USC’s AFRICOM conference</a>
 earlier this month and between panel discussions and offline 
conversations, I came away with a new appreciation (and hope) for the 
newest, and very different, command. …</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://mountainrunner.us/2008/03/measuring_public_diplomacy.html">Measuring “Public Diplomacy”?</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>What “nine annual and long-term outcomes” would you use 
to measure America’s public diplomacy apparatus?  State has apparently 
found them.</p>
<p>The American concept of “public diplomacy” is a strange one.  As 
Americans, we seek a return on our investments.  It’s in our blood.  If 
there is no clear payback, then there’s no clear value and there’s no 
reason to continue.  Public diplomacy is no different as we, unique to 
perhaps the rest of the world, view it as discrete <em>cylinder of excellence</em>
 that must be measured to prove its worth.  Numerous reports as well as 
historic and recent prominent officials have noted, public diplomacy is 
presented as something that lacks a domestic constituency and thus 
support for its programs must be somehow explained. …</p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<h3><a href="http://mountainrunner.us/2008/03/not_afraid_to_talk_our_adversa.html">Not Afraid to Talk: our adversaries aren’t, why are we?</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://mountainrunner.us/2008/03/not_afraid_to_talk_our_adversa.html"> </a></p>
<blockquote><p>To begin with, we must accept that the romantic days of 
the United States Information Agency are gone.  So many confuse the USIA
 and the other information services, such as Radio Free Europe and Radio
 Liberty, of recent decades with the USIA that was engaged in the active
 psychological struggle that largely ended with détente and the 
finalizing of the European partition.  It was only after this aggressive
 period ended was “public diplomacy” coined, twelve years after USIA was
 created.</p>
<p>Unlike half a century ago, the U.S. military has a clear voice and is
 arguably our dominant public diplomat. Therefore, simply resurrecting 
“USIA” without reorganizing our national information capabilities across
 civilian and military lines would turn it into just another voice 
struggling to be heard over America’s military commanders, 
spokespersons, and warfighters. …</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://uscpublicdiplomacy.com/index.php/newsroom/pdblog_detail/synchronizing_information_the_importance_of_new_media_in_conflict/">Synchronizing Information: The Importance of New Media in Conflict</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://uscpublicdiplomacy.com/index.php/newsroom/pdblog_detail/synchronizing_information_the_importance_of_new_media_in_conflict/"> </a></p>
<blockquote><p>The effectiveness of information campaigns today will 
more often dictate a victory than how well bullets and bombs are put on a
 target. Putting information on target is more important when dealing 
with an asymmetric adversary that cannot – and does not need to – match 
the military or economic power of the United States and her allies.</p>
<p>Insurgents and terrorists increasingly leverage New Media to shape 
perceptions around the globe to be attractive to some and intimidating 
to others. New Media collapses traditional concepts of time and space as
 information moves around the world in an instant. Unlike traditional 
media, <a href="http://mountainrunner.us/2006/02/google.html">search engines</a> and the web in general, enable information, factual or not, to be quickly and easily accessed long after it was created.</p>
<p>The result is a shift in the purpose of physical engagement to increasingly incorporate the <em>information effect</em>
 of words and deeds. Thus, the purpose of improvised explosive devices, 
for example, is not to kill or maim Americans but to replay images of <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/section/Provocations/america_should_hire_al-qaedas_pr_agent">David sticking it to Goliath.</a> …</p></blockquote>
<p>As readers, publishers, and proponents of “new media”, we need to 
push blogging as a platform for intelligent, quality content and 
discussion relevant to professionals in our field. Not simply a place to
 post about our pets. I am glad to see the conflict/IR blogosphere 
making steady progress in that direction.</p>

 with UNOSAT’s ability to use satellite imagery in creative ways. On

 towards the Cameroonian border. The <a href="http://unosat.web.cern.ch/unosat/freeproducts/Chad/NDjamena_Refugees_Feb08/UNOSAT_NDjamena_Refugee_Movement_BridgeZone1_4Feb08_Lowres_v1.pdf">satellite photos are simply stunning</a>.
 This is the first set of images I have seen capturing the epic scale of
 refugee flows. Each point on the photo is an individual and each yellow
 box a vehicle. The UN estimates that one photo contains 10,200 
pedestrians and 80 vehicles.</p>

PMRS has photos of the damage on their <a href="http://www.pmrs.ps/last/photogallery.php?cat=32&amp;big=1&amp;y=1">website</a>.
 The strike was in retaliation for more than 70 Palestinian rockets 
fired into Israel, one of which landed on the grounds of a local Israeli
 hospital. Neither the Palestinian nor Israeli attacks was officially 
targeting health facilities.</p>
<p>Why am I showing you this? Because damage to the health 
infrastructure is a primary cause of indirect morbidity and mortality 
during wartime. Despite myths to the contrary, dead bodies are not the 
catalysts of epidemics. Rather, it is the loss of health infrastructures
 (hospitals, clinics, etc…). When a region loses its health 
infrastructure it is unable to combat diseases endemic in the area, 
which quickly flare up. That is, in peacetime local health 
infrastructures keep local diseases in check through treatment and 
public health programs. When that infrastructure is destroyed, this 
check is removed and diseases spread rapidly.</p>

<p>IRIN has a story on the risk of <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=76781">HIV amongst former child soldiers through sex or drug abuse</a>,
 particularly in Uganda. This phenomena, well studied in public health 
research literature, finds that both the ability of an individual to 
adapt (strong social connections, etc…) and the rate of change in their 
environment (social, economic, etc…) are powerful determinants of 
health. But, as far as I know, this research has not been extended into 
the developing world.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have found that in places like Sierra Leone, large 
numbers of demobilised child soldiers are increasingly injecting illegal
 drugs,” said Dr Josef Decosas, senior HIV policy adviser at Plan 
International, a development agency working for and with children. “And 
we know that as soon as HIV comes into a network of drug users it 
spreads like wildfire.”</p>
<p>He said recent research had shown that conflict tended to curb the 
spread of HIV by limiting movement and social interactions, but when 
wars ended these communities returned to normal and mobility increased, 
so HIV became a real issue.</p>
<p>“In Uganda, the HIV prevalence in the LRA [rebel Lord's Resistance 
Army] is thought to be quite low, but in northern Uganda’s local 
population it is quite high, so demobilised children need to be prepared
 to avoid HIV,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Five years after Congo’s devastating war “ended”, the country’s death rate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/world/africa/23congo.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Lydia+Polgreen%2C+health&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin">remains the same</a>.
 These are the findings of a survey released in mid January. The study 
estimates 45,000 die every month in the Congo, the same numbers as 
revealed by a wartime survey in 2004.</p>
<blockquote><p>Still, improvements in security since 2004, when the last
 survey was completed, meant that researchers were able to visit many 
areas that were off limits last time, and as a result, its authors said,
 the current survey provides the most complete picture yet of the toll 
of Congo’s slide into despair.</p>
<p>That picture is not encouraging. The survey found that the mortality 
rate in&nbsp; Congo is 57 percent higher than in the rest of sub-Saharan
 Africa. Particularly hard hit were young children, who are especially 
susceptible to diseases like <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/malaria/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">malaria</a>, <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/measles/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">measles</a>, dysentery and <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/typhoid-fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">typhoid</a>,
 serious killers in the absence of medicine. In one village in North 
Kivu Province, a hot spot of continued fighting, three women of the 20 
households surveyed had lost two children each in the 16 months covered 
by the survey period, Dr. Brennan said.</p>
<p>Less than half a percentage point of the deaths were caused by 
violence, illustrating how the aftermath of war can be more deadly than 
combat itself. Much of the emergency aid is focused on the eastern part 
of the country, where militia battles with Congolese troops have chased 
nearly half a million people from their homes in the last year. A peace 
agreement to end that conflict was reached Monday.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Economist <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10609541">reports</a>
 on the overpopulation of young, unemployed men in both Gaza and Kenya. 
In both regions, economic development has lagged behind gains in health 
and education, creating a generation of poor and disgruntled young 
people. These generations can be a major source of insecurity and they 
are prime recruits for insurgencies and criminal organizations.</p>
<p>This phenomena reminds me of research finding the best predictor of 
lynchings in the American South was the price of cotton. That is, the 
gap between economic expectations and reality created a behavioral 
proclivity towards violence. I will see if I am can dig up the specific

<p>The always enjoyable blog, <a href="http://newsecuritybeat.blogspot.com/2008/01/refugees-bushmeat-consumption.html">New Security Beat</a>,
 reports on a growing poaching&nbsp; problem in Tanzania. Interestingly,
 the poachers are not criminals after Ivory, but refugees after protein.
 Refugees in Tanzania have started eating local wildlife as a source of 
protein, sorely lacking in their UN provided food. The problem is that 
the refugees’ free protein often comes from chimpanzees and other 
endangered species.</p>
<blockquote><p>In response to the report’s assertions, Christiane 
Berthiaume of the UN World Food Programme, which feeds 215,000 refugees 
in Tanzania, said that meat spoils quickly, and substituting canned meat
 for the cheaper beans that currently supply the refugees with protein 
would <a href="http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/29758">cost an additional $46 million</a> over the estimated $60 million currently dedicated to feeding refugees in Tanzania during 2007 and 2008.</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p>The study of genocide rarely brings up connotations of <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R-code</a> and heteroskedasiticity, but it should. Jina Moore at the Christian Science Monitor has a story on <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0207/p20s01-wogn.htm">Patrick Ball</a>, a statistician and expert on the quantitative study of genocide. </p>
<blockquote><p>Like all statisticians, Ball began with the most basic 
hypothesis: In looking for a common cause, he is already wrong. 
Statistics begins with an original assumption – that everything is 
random – and discards it only when the data suggest otherwise. In Ball’s
 case, they did: He found patterns in the mass movement of refugees 
strong enough to suggest that more than ordinary wartime chaos was at 
work. At the same time, the relationship between migration and NATO or 
KLA actions was so weak that he knew neither was the cause. </p>
<p>Statisticians have a language for description without interpretation.
 When the analysis showed the movements were neither random nor likely 
to follow NATO or KLA activities, Ball wrote: "The migration patterns of
 Kosovar Albanians are consistent with the hypothesis that there was a 
coordinated and organized effort to drive them from their homes." In 
layman’s terms, the data suggested ethnic cleansing. In fact, the 
migration patterns matched killing patterns "so unbelievably perfectly" 
that he concluded that the two situations might be explained by the same
 external influence. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quantitative study of conflict fills an important role in both 
research and policy. The statistical analysis of data, while lacking the
 glamour of other approaches, can reveal patterns otherwise concealed. 
In recent years quantitative methodology has grown in popularity in 
political science. This trend has lead to numerous <a href="http://americanandcomparativejobs.blogspot.com/2007/12/methodologytheory-debates.html">heated exchanges</a>
 between qualitative and quantitative researchers. Regarding the role of
 statistics in conflict studies, I think Ball has the right attitude:</p>
<blockquote><p>But even so devoted a numbers guy knows graphs don’t tell
 the whole story. "Statistics define the limits of what’s plausible and 
what’s not plausible," he says. "Statistics do not tell us how it felt 
to be there." </p>
<p>In 2000, just after a Kosovo newspaper published his conclusions 
about migration, Ball was on a radio show. "Someone called in and said, 
‘I’m in your graph,’" he recalls. "The peak, right there, that’s where I
 was. I could feel that wave.’ " </p>

 While at the Naval Postgraduate School, a smart US Army civil affairs 
officer pointed out that Afghans’ animals are their prized possessions. 
The wealth of villages is easily determined by looking at the health of 
their livestock. Given this, the military has been running veterinary 
programs in Afghanistan to help win over hearts and minds. Not a bad 
idea at all. Recently, I stumbled <a href="http://www.ugandacan.org/item/2593">upon a program</a> which hints at an expansion of this practice into Africa:</p>
<blockquote><p>US military forces have launched a veterinary project in 
Gulu and Amuru displaced persons’ camps that aims to vaccinate 12,000 
cattle and 130,000 goats over the next month. The US team, working with 
the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture, will be treating the livestock free
 of charge.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the type of program I love to see. Winning hearts and minds 
through applying US power to health, even if it is for animals. The 
operations are low cost (relative to combat), cause positive “collateral
 damage”, and attack the social networks which breed political / 
religious radicalism.</p>

<p>Last March, IRIN <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=70721">reported</a>
 that Taliban forces were blocking polio vaccination programs in Uruzgan
 Province, Afghanistan. In one case, a government polio vaccinator, 
doing field work, was kidnapped by Taliban forces:</p>
<blockquote><p>“They slapped my face. They held me for eight hours 
before releasing me,” the 35-year-old said. “They made me promise that I
 would not vaccinate any more children – threatening to kill me if I 
did.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The targeting of health workers was confirmed by purported Taliban 
spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmad, stating “If [aid workers] won’t stop their 
work, we will target them, like we’ve targeted them in the past”.</p>
<p>Open warfare against health workers is a de facto acknowledgement by 
the Taliban that health services are a successful counterinsurgency 
strategy. Afghanistan is one of only four countries with endemic polio 
and, as such, vaccination programs can be an effective strategy for 
winning hearts and minds.</p>
<p>The concept of polio vaccination programs as a COIN strategy fits 
into a larger argument I have been developing, that health represents 
not just an indicator of success / failure in war, but is itself a 
front. That is, health in war is not simply an effect of battle but, in 
some circumstances, a cause of battle.</p>

<p>Jeff Gettleman of the New York Times makes the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/world/africa/21kenya.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">troubling suggestion</a> that the violence ravaging Kenya over the last few weeks might have been planned.</p>
<blockquote><p>At first the violence seemed as spontaneous as it was 
shocking, with machete-wielding mobs hacking people to death and burning
 women and children alive in a country that was celebrated as one of 
Africa’s most stable.</p>
<p>But a closer look at what has unfolded in the past three weeks, since
 a deeply flawed election plunged Kenya into chaos, shows that some of 
the bloodletting that has left more than 650 people dead may have been 
premeditated and organized.</p>
<p>Leaflets calling for ethnic killings mysteriously appeared before the
 voting. Politicians with both the government and opposition parties 
gave speeches that stoked long-standing hatred among ethnic groups. And 
local tribal chiefs held meetings to plot attacks on rivals, according 
to some of them and their followers.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/donaldrothchild.htm">Donald Rothchild</a>, a professor at UC Davis and expert on ethnic violence, who sadly passed away last year, was said to have a favorite saying: <em>There are no spontaneous rallies</em>.
 Behind all mass violence lies the machinations of a society’s elite. 
With the situation in Kenya not getting any better, Don’s words are food
 for thought.</p>

<p>UNOSAT has release <a href="http://unosat.web.cern.ch/unosat/freeproducts/kenya/2008/UNOSAT_Nairobi_Damage_Overview_7Jan08_Highres_v1.pdf">another map</a> depicting Kenyan post-election violence. The new map shows damage in two areas of Nairobi: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibera">Kibera</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huruma">Huruma</a>.
 Interestingly, the number of buildings destroyed / severely damaged 
(shown in the yellow box)  is estimated by dividing the total area 
affected by the mean building size. As with the first UNOSAT map 
previously <a href="http://warandhealth.com/mapping-kenyan-election-violence-via-satellite/">discussed</a>,
 I am impressed with the attempts to use satellites as a method for 
international actors to measure the level of violence. As this 
methodology develops and the cost of satellite imagery lowers, its 
applicability will only increase. Click the image to see the full map

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/counting-iraqs-dead.jpg" alt="Counting the Dead" align="right">On January 9th <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMsa0707782">a new Iraq War mortality study</a>
 was released by the New England Journal of Medicine. This study 
represents the third major attempt to count Iraqi deaths since the start
 of the war. <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">Iraq Body Count</a>
 was the first attempt, counting the number of deaths published in news 
reports. The operators of Iraq Body Count freely admit the real number 
is likely much higher and that their value (<strong>47,668</strong>) represents at best a minimum value. The second attempt was the now infamous “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/international/europe/29casualties.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1124596800&amp;en=0d7c73498d7a75c2&amp;ei=5070&amp;ex=1100494800&amp;en=98a258b1c2ea35d8&amp;ei=5070&amp;oref=slogin">Lancet</a>” and “<a href="http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/56124/">Lancet II</a>” studies whose validity was blasted this week in a <a href="http://news.nationaljournal.com/articles/databomb/index.htm">National Journal article (good read)</a>. The last of the Lancet survey-based studies found <strong>601,027 </strong>Iraqi deaths since 2003. The National Journal article eloquently puts the magnitude of that number into perspective:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The February 2006 bombing of the Golden Mosque is widely
 credited with plunging Iraq into civil war, yet the Lancet II report 
posits the equivalent of five to 10 bombings of this magnitude in Iraq 
every day for three years.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This latest study from the Iraq Family Health Survey Study Group is based off 9345 household surveys and estimated <strong>151,000</strong> violent deaths from March 2003 through June 2006:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewers visited 89.4% of 1086 household clusters 
during the study period; the household response rate was 96.2%. From 
January 2002 through June 2006, there were 1325 reported deaths. After 
adjustment for missing clusters, the overall rate of death per 1000 
person-years was 5.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.89 to 5.77); the 
estimated rate of violence-related death was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.81 to 
1.50). When underreporting was taken into account, the rate of 
violence-related death was estimated to be 1.67 (95% uncertainty range, 
1.24 to 2.30). This rate translates into an estimated number of violent 
deaths of 151,000 (95% uncertainty range, 104,000 to 223,000) from March
 2003 through June 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>One finding which is consistent across all three studies is that 
violence was a leading cause of death amongst Iraqi adults. This is 
contrary to what we find in wars historically. Infectious disease 
typically far outnumbers violent deaths. This historic discrepancy might
 be caused by Iraq’s relatively (compared to previous wars and even the 
modern states) high levels of pre-war education and quality healthcare.</p>

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/ushahidi.png" alt="Ushahidi" align="right">Over
 the summer Jen (my wife) spent three months in Kisumu, Kenya starting a
 sports-based HIV/AIDs education program. Sadly in recent weeks things 
have not been looking too good in Kisumu. Kisumu is in a Luo dominated 
region, the ethnic group of the Kenyan opposition leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raila_Odinga">Raila Odinga</a>,
 and experienced significant post-election violence. In the first few 
days my wife was glued to BBC. What struck me was that my wife faced an 
informational level of analysis problem. There was certainly news coming
 out of Kenya, but the news was at a national level. While any 
information is welcome, what my wife was really desperate to find was 
information about locations in Kisumu itself. That is, local level 
information. The information coming in over the mainstream media only 
mentioned Kisumu in vague one or two sentence blurbs about “violence in 
the city”. What Jen needed was information on the status of 
neighborhoods in Kisumu, not aggregate national level news.</p>
<p>So, you can imagine my happiness upon finding out that <a href="http://whiteafrican.com/">White African</a>, <a href="http://www.kenyanpundit.com/">Kenyan Pundit</a>, and <a href="http://www.mentalacrobatics.com/">ot</a><a href="http://afromusing.com/blog/">her</a> <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/www.skunkworks-ke.blogspot.com">bloggers</a> got together and launched a site to facilitate the exchange of just such local information. <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushadhidi</a>
 (Swahili for “witness”) is a mash-up between Google Maps and social 
networking. Visitors report the description and location of different 
types of violence over a map of Kenya. This information is then viewable
 by other visitors.</p>
<p>To my knowledge the earliest major use of a Google Maps mash-up focused on sharing local level disaster information was <a href="http://www.scipionus.com/">Scipionus</a>.
 Scipionus was a much cruder use of Google Maps, but even so was very 
useful as an information exchange. Interestingly, the year after Katrina
 I eagerly mentioned the idea of using social networking websites as 
disaster information exchanges during a presentation for a graduate 
level international health seminar. The idea was met with almost 
universal skepticism amongst the students and professor. I knew they 
were wrong then and I hope projects like Ushahidi changes their mind.</p>
<p>Exploiting “smart mobs” to share information during disasters is 
undoubtedly part of the future of disaster management. After / during a 
disaster information is not so much scare but scattered. In Hurricane 
Katrina, SMS messages from victims sent to family California was not 
shared with the information from cell phone calls of other survivors to 
relatives in New York. Thus, information on the disaster ends up 
resembling a puzzle with geographically and socially scattered 
individuals each holding one informational piece each. The beauty of 
Ushahidi is in collecting these puzzle pieces and putting them together.
 They offer the both the possibility of providing local level 
information and a more comprehensive snapshot of its national level 
effects. So good luck Ushahidi, I hope you get some information from 
Kisumu soon!</p>

<p>Using commercially and publicly available satellite images, <a href="http://unosat.web.cern.ch/unosat/">UNOSAT</a>,
 a UN program working with satellite images and GIS (geographic 
information systems) tracked fires causes by post election violence in 
Kenya’s Rift Valley Province. The resulting map offers an aerial 
snapshot of Kenya’s political violence and one of the most poignant maps
 I have seen in a while (click on the image to view the whole map, PDF).</p>
<blockquote><p>This map depicts the chronology of detected active fire 
locations within the Rift Valley Province in western Kenya following the
 national elections on 27 Dec.2007. These fire locations were detected 
by the MODIS satellites covering the time period from 27 Dec. to 3 
Jan.2008, and organized into 4 maps each covering a 2 day period. An 
evaluation has been made of the chronology and spatial context of this 
data, and it is probable that a majority of detected fires (peaking on 1
 January 2008) are directly or indirectly linked to the electoral civil 
unrest.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/2008/01/insourcing-the-tools-of-nation/">Small Wars Journal</a> has a good piece by <a href="http://www.mountainrunner.us/">MountainRunner</a> on in-sourcing national power. Here is the gist of the argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>needs to take a 
systematic, holistic “whole of government” approach to reconstruction 
and stabilization that puts the focus on meeting the basic needs of the 
people in these countries. This shouldn’t be about what the <span class="caps">U.S. </span>needs
 or wants, but what the people of the country in question need and want.
 Basically, when people are safe, secure, full (not hungry), engaged and
 comfortable, they have no need to fight or support terrorists. 
Terrorists work by instigating and sustaining instability, fear, and 
discomfort (disillusionment) and if the <span class="caps">USG </span>fights buys-in to this approach by fighting back with hard-power only, it just perpetuates the cycle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt’s analysis is spot on. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307265625?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=warandhea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307265625">Rupert Smith</a>‘s “wars amongst the people” and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745638546?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=warandhea-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0745638546">Mary Kaldor</a>‘s
 “new wars” cannot be won by the pointy end of the spear (read: military
 force) alone. Modern conflict requires a human security perspective 
where victory is obtained <em>more</em> through civilian programs than 
military operations. A force prepared for these wars needs more than 
just boots on the ground, but also wingtips (diplomatic), booties 
(health), steel-toes (engineering), and Birkenstock (NGOs). The military
 component of such a force does not seek victory through the destruction
 of the enemy (impossible in modern conflict) but simply provides the 
security and stability necessary for the civilian / political components
 to achieve a sustainable, successful outcome.</p>

<p><img src="conflict-health-posts-400-500_files/fps-ci.jpg" alt="Facilities Protection Service" align="right">Security
 at Iraqi hospitals is provided by the Facilities Protection Service 
(FPS), the security wing of the Ministry of Interior. Officially a 4,000
 strong force created to free up  coalition forces from static building 
protection duties after the looting in Baghdad, by 2006 it had 
reportedly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300843.html">bloated to over 145,000 men</a>.
 Furthermore, around the same time, the FPS was connected to a number of
 sectarian death squads operating in Iraq. To rein in the FPS, the Iraqi
 Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has started incorporating all FPS units 
under a unified command.</p>
<p><a href="http://aliveinbaghdad.org/2007/10/22/hospital-guards-more-than-protectors/">Alive in Baghdad</a>,
 a weekly video blog employing Iraqi journalists to produce videos on 
daily life in Iraq, has a piece on the FPS guards at the Ibn Al-Nafees 
Hospital in Bagdad’s Karrada neighborhood. Despite their negative 
portrayal in the media, the guards are shown to be dedicated civil 
servants. They protect hospital personnel, facilities, and ambulances, 
and sometimes even assist with medical treatments. But wait, how can the
 FPS be both a tool of militant death squads and the guardian angel of 
the Iraqi healthcare system?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the convoluted nature of the FPS. While FPS 
personnel are (atleast on paper) part of the Ministry of the Interior, 
most of the guards work for and are paid by the ministry whose 
facilities they protect. Thus, when Lt. Colonel Mu’ayad Abd Al-Hasssan 
Taqfiq, the FPS officer in charge of hospital security, speaks about 
working “in cooperation with the Ministry of Interior and the Army”, he 
shows that his hospital guards, while FPS, do not consider themselves 
part of the MOI but rather part of the Iraqi Ministry of Health.</p>
